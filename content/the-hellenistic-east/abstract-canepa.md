abstract: |
    Bronze enjoyed a special status in Hellenistic Asia both because of its ability to take on a bright finish and for its associations with prestigious cultic and royal contexts. Although the medium was certainly not unknown in the lands of the former Achaemenid Empire and the earlier cultures of ancient Western Asia, the new Graeco-Macedonian modes of representation and royal cultures transformed the role of bronze sculpture in these regions.

    This paper examines the dynamic intersection between medium, style, and political and religious power in the dissolution of the Seleucid Empire and rise of the new Iranian political and visual cultures of power under such dynasties as the Arsakids, Orontids, and Mithradatids.
