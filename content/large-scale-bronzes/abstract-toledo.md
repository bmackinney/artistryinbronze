    This project studies the influence of ancient bronzes on Cuban large-scale sculptures that are still on display in Havana today. It focuses on the process of creation and construction of three specific works, located in the capitol of the Republic of Cuba in the twentieth century.

    These pieces are *The Republic*, *The Progress of Human Activity*, and *The Virtue of the People*. They were commissioned from the Italian sculptor Angelo Zanelli (1879â€“1942), who created them and was in charge of placing them in the capitol. This poster explains the impact they had on the Cuban architectural style of the period.
