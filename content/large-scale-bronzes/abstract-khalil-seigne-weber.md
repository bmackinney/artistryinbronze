    In 1993, 2012, and 2014, well-preserved partial remains of a large bronze workshop were uncovered at the Sanctuary of Zeus in Jerash. Thanks to the close cooperation between Jordanian, German, and French specialists, more than three thousand mold fragments have been restored and the other relevant installations of the workshop, dated to the second half of the second century AD, preserved. All the pieces will be accessible, as a unique cultural heritage monument of Jordan, through an exhibit in the Jordan National Museum.

    The bronze workshop was located on the lower terrace of the Zeus sanctuary. At the moment, its remains include four large mold pits, with traces of large copper-alloy cast objects at the bottom (two circular, two rectangular in plan). Some three thousand pieces of the smashed mold mantle (consisting of baked earth), along with numerous fragments of the furnaces and other installations, had been dumped into these pits when the casting process was finished. The negative impression on the interiors of the mold fragments led to the conclusion that large-sized draped statuary, as well as other objects (cultic instruments?), was fabricated in this workshop by the lost-wax procedure.
