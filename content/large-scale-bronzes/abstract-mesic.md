    The main goal of this paper is to present the discovery and underwater survey of the ancient Apoxyomenos and to explore the mystery of how the statue ended up at the bottom of the sea.

    A Belgian diver, R. Wouters, discovered the bronze statue of the Apoxyomenos by chance while diving in the waters off the island of Mali Lošinj in the Republic of Croatia. The statue was found at a depth of 46 meters, on a curved seabed, stuck between two rocks. After very exacting preparations, which included the advice of many experts, the process of excavation began. The statue was brought to the surface with the cooperation of underwater archaeologists and members of the special police. Afterward, the Apoxyomenos was delivered to conservators. A month of research was then conducted at the underwater site where the statue was found.

    The research was international in character, with English, Belgian, and Croatian divers. They were driven by the same goal: to find other discoveries and possibly the underwater shipwreck. Unfortunately, despite detailed investigation with underwater metal detectors and waterpipes, the shipwreck has never been found. Does this mean that we will never find out how the Apoxyomenos ended up on the seabed? To answer this question, we will have to look more deeply into historical, geographical, climatic, and nautical contexts.
