    This poster discusses the major issues related to modern studies on objects and materials of historical or cultural heritage. These usually involve the use of non-destructive and microanalytical techniques, which are employed for various purposes and particularly for cultural heritage. The conservation and restoration of materials and artifacts requires analytical methods that can yield information on the chemical nature and composition of selected parts of artifacts to elucidate their provenance; on the state of alteration of the object as a result of short-, medium-, and long-term exposure to environmental conditions; and on the effectiveness of conservation strategies during and after application. This poster describes the application of non-destructive and microanalytical techniques to an ibis statue of the Late Period in Egyptian civilization, which was excavated from Tuna el-Gabal in Al-Minya Governate by Cairo University in 1946; the object is currently in the inorganic storeroom at Grand Egyptian Museum Conservation Center. It is obvious from visual examination and analytical techniques that the object was made from a variety of materials. Previous interventions showed contemporary support by the wooden base with iron pins and wire, and determined the nature of the corrosion product on the statue’s metal surface (identified by XRD analysis and SEM-EDS). The statue is missing part of a leg, and this poster will discuss possible and suitable ways to extend the statue’s life with safe and stable material (Plexiglas), which does not react with any material used in the artifacts of the ancient Egyptian civilization.
