    In the winter of 2005, an emergency archaeological excavation was carried out at the village of Chubtarash, in the Kargah Valley near the city of Khorramabad, Western Iran. Some artifacts from the middle of Parthian period (about first century AD) were found. The most important find of the excavation was a large metallic bathtub-like coffin in which a skeleton was found with two gold strips covering its eyes and mouth. The coffin has four handles that are joined to the tub-like body with pins. The coffin now is preserved in Falak-ol-Aflak Museum of Khorramabad.

    To identify the manufacturing process of the coffin, a technical examination was performed by visual examination, SEM-EDS analysis, and optical microscopy (metallography).

    The results showed that the coffinâ€™s body is made of binary copper-tin (bronze) alloy. Other elements such as arsenic, lead, zinc, and nickel are detected as minor/trace elements. The handles also are made of tin bronze alloy, but with a different amount of tin. The observations and microstructural examination of samples revealed that the tub-like body of the coffin was manufactured in one piece, and a cycle of mechanical working and heat treatment was applied in order to shape the coffin. The bronze handles were made by casting, and some work was done on them to finish the final shape. The technical examinations on this individual bronze coffin from Iran illuminated some aspects of archaeometallurgical activities in the Parthian period of Iran.
