  This study compares analytical and methodological variations present in the copper alloys (bronze and brass) used to craft weapon (i.e., helmets, swords, spearheads) and ornaments (i.e., Classical Greek sculptures). IPCE’s Scientific Department made numerous analytic studies to evaluate the chemical stability and physical integrity of the artifacts. X-ray, XFR, and MEB-SEM were performed to determine composition and the presence of active corrosion.

  The study is made by comparing pieces from various Spanish state museums, which have been analyzed and undergone restoration and conservation during recent years by the Subdirectory of the Spanish Historical Heritage Institute.
