  A fine caryatid mirror formerly in the collection of Julien Greau was recently determined to be a pastiche of Greek and Etruscan, ancient and modern. It is well established that the corpus of bronze caryatid mirrors contains a large number of fakes. This paper analyzes the production of these objects within the social context of nineteenth-century Paris.

  After decades of upheaval and transformation as a result of Hausmannization, cultural anxieties surrounding modernity resulted in an increased interest in collecting antiquities. While large numbers of Greek antiquities made their way into the European market as a result of expanded excavations as well as looting, many required heavy restoration in order to make them marketable to an increasingly bourgeois collecting public. The distinction between a restored object, a pastiche, and a total fabrication broke down over time, especially as the diminishing flow of Greek imports failed to keep up with demand.

  Within the larger context of the antiquities market in late nineteenth-century Paris, I argue that bronzes were of special interest to collectors. On the one hand, metals were an essential aspect of industrialization, as symbolized most dramatically by the construction of *la tour Eiffel* for the 1889 *Exposition universelle*. In many ways, metals represented both a link with the past and a path to the future. Small-scale bronze sculptures were, like the terracotta Tanagras, easily replicable, affordable for a mass market, and conveniently displayed on a mantel or shelf. Finally, the caryatid mirror held special appeal on account of its functional familiarity, but also because the female figure provided a model for women just as the French feminist movement was redefining modern femininity.
