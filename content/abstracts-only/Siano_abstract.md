  The archaeometallurgical study of the metal artifacts is fundamental to their analysis and valorization. Material analyses and technological interpretations can contribute substantially to the revelation of cultural contents, which are complementary to historical and archaeological interpretations. Archaeometallurgy, in addition to reconstructing the history of objects’ technological development based on compositional and structural evidence, can allow discrimination between originals and replicas, recognizing possible integrations. It can also shed light on the creative process.

  After about half a century of investigations into the manufacturing processes of ancient large bronzes, a great deal of material data has been collected on several masterpieces. However, the interpretation of the evidence and analytical measurements can sometime be very complex, and results are often equivocal. Naked-eye observations, radiography, and some chemical analyses rarely permit the prompt determination of raw materials, crafting procedures of the wax model, core structure, casting set-up, assembly, and finishing. On the contrary, thorough objective morphological and structural examinations, accurate compositional mapping, and very critical interpretation of the data are needed in order to reduce the range of the compatible technical interpretations. With the growing body of data comes an increasingly complex technological picture; some execution processes, which were once believed to be well-established practices in ancient times, today represent only a rather partial list of the methods used in Classical and Hellenistic art foundries.

  Within this framework, the large bronzes of the Medici collections, exhibited at Florence’s National Museum of Archaeology, offer noteworthy examples of the methodological variability and of hitherto unknown peculiarities of ancient production, which significantly broaden the interpretational perspective. The Idolino from Pesaro (Iozzo 1998), the Minerva (Cygielman 2008) and the Chimaera of Arezzo (Siano et al. 2012; Siano 2013), the Arringatore (discovered in the environs of Lake Trasimeno), and Horse’s Head (see chapter 39 of this volume) have been thoroughly investigated during the last two decades. The present contribution discusses the main aspects of these studies along with their general implications in terms of methodological approach and knowledge of the ancient art foundry.
