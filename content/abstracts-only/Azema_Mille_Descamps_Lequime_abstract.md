  The fragmentary bronze statue (Louvre Museum inv. Br 4388; 63.5 cm x 29 cm) was discovered in ploughed land near a rich Roman villa in Epiais-Rhus, northwestern France, which preserves the remains of a Gallo-Roman city. After being used as a flowerpot for some years, the statue was acquired by the Louvre in 1959 (Piganiol 1961, 295). A wing was discovered around the same area in 1977, which has been attributed to this statue and reattached to its back. The bronze sculpture depicts Eros as a baby; its prototype derives from a Hellenistic model (Mattusch 1996, 160–68). The Sleeping Eros type is rare among extant large bronzes: only few other examples are known, such as the remarkable Sleeping Eros in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (Hemingway 2015) and a head from Volubilis (Boube-Piccot 1969, no. 174, 160–61, plates 90–92).

  In order to investigate the manufacture and the dating of the Louvre’s statue, a technological study was carried out at the C2RMF. Study of the inner wall was eased by the open access at the back of the statue, and completed by X-radiography. Elemental composition was determined on micro-samples analyzed by PIXE. The statue appears to have been cast in nine separate hollow parts mainly by the indirect lost-wax process. A tin bronze with a high lead content (Sn: 7 wt%; Pb: 25 wt%) was used. The separately cast parts were then assembled using flow fusion welding or brazing, depending on the shape of the join (in basins or using a platform). Some other clues (such as fingerprints in the wax) helped to reconstruct each step of the manufacture with more detail and to qualify the Sleeping Eros from Epiais-Rhus as a large bronze statue elaborated during the second century AD.
