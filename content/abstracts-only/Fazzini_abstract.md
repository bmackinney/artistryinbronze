  This contribution examines the Roman-era bronze artisansâ€™ techniques and their methods for overcoming difficulties in casting small objects. In observing a group of small bronzes from Marche, an Italian region, realized with the lost-wax technique, we noticed some interesting features about the methods of production. The techniques for improving the casting involve, primarily, the positioning of the casting and vent channels. They can be seen in proximity to those parts of the casting that were more difficult for the molten metal to reach. During the realization of the wax model, the metal workers concealed the channels so as to become a part of the final sculpture itself, hidden in columns, trunks, or drapery.
