abstract: >
  Two exceptional Greek original bronze statues were discovered underwater at Riace Marina (Calabria, Italy), in 1972. The statues represent a pair of warriors or athletes and are commonly labeled Statue A and Statue B. On the basis of stylistic studies, many authors date Statue A to 470–460 BC, and Statue B to 440–430 BC (Arias 1986).

  During the restoration campaign carried out in Rome at the ICR, the inner cavities of the bronzes were explored and cleaned by remote-controlled mechanical arms. Here we report the archaeometric investigation of 12 metal samples taken from the inside of the statues: 3 bronze and 1 lead samples from Statue A; and 3 welding alloys, 3 bronze, and 2 lead samples from Statue B.

  Chemical and textural investigation of the Cu-alloy samples was performed by SEM-EDS, EPMA, and metallographic analyses on polished cross sections. The data are discussed and compared with literature data available for coeval statues. Moreover, the lead isotopic compositions of selected samples were investigated by MC-ICP-MS. Comparison of the results with existing Pb-isotope databases (OXALID; BRETTSCAIFE.net; Alpine Archaeocopper Project) shows that the copper used for Statue A is compatible with western Mediterranean deposits, whereas the copper of Statue B fit with eastern Mediterranean ores. The isotopic signals of the welding samples from Statue B show a different provenance, possibly related to the age of the welding operations. The lead of the tenons of both statues has a very well defined isotopic signal compatible with a Greek source.
