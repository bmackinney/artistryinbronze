abstract: The two reconstructions of Polykleitos’s lost *Spear-Bearer* in bronze can tell us many stories. They were both made in Munich from three Roman copies between 1910 and 1921. This paper addresses the bronzes’ place in history: in ancient art, in Stettin and Munich, and in Germany after the First and Second World Wars.
