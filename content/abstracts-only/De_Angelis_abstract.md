abstract: >
  Bronze *thymiateria* produced in Etruria from the Archaic to the Hellenistic age often include in their shapes components that make more or less explicit reference to specific properties of the artifacts themselves. These components can be abstract (e.g., series of superimposed discoid and lenticular elements) or figural (typically, human figures that support the stem of the *thymiaterion*; but also animals and isolated limbs such as legs). In both cases, they appear to underscore the aspects of gravity, lightness, and equilibrium.

  This paper will argue that such aspects can be related to the actual functions of the incense-burners. They thereby serve as self-conscious visual commentaries on the perceived nature of these implements. At the same time, their analysis can also shed light on the multifaceted ways in which Greek ponderation was received and understood in Etruria.
