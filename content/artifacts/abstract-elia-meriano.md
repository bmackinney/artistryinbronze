    A considerable number of outstanding bronze artifacts were retrieved from the sanctuaries and the necropolis of Locri Epizefiri, including mirrors with figured handles, rare instruments related to the symposium, and refined appliqués, among others (Cameron 1979; Meirano 2002). Notwithstanding the attention these objects have received in the bibliography—especially regarding their function and symbolic values according to find contexts—several aspects still require investigation.

    Most of these items are attributed to local workshops due to technical, iconographic, and stylistic considerations and, like other local products, are considered to be almost exclusively intended for the internal market.

    The analysis of the features of Locrian bronze objects allows for a reassessment of the local productive milieu between the sixth and the fourth centuries BC, a period that is characterized by traditionalism, external influences, and hybridism, as well as originality in the choice of iconographies and in the creation of specific items. The Locrian case study provided a unique opportunity to understand the eclectic re-elaboration of patterns and morphology, and the adoption of novelty elements coming from different traditions, aimed at satisfying the tastes of the local elite. Besides, the recent reexamination of find contexts—namely the funerary assemblages (Elia 2010)—offers the opportunity to define an autonomous chronological system to be integrated with considerations deriving from stylistic analysis.
