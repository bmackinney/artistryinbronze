    A rostrum (*embolos* in ancient Greek, “naval ram” in English) was an offensive naval weapon mounted on the prow of a ship at the waterline and was used to damage enemy warships. The rostrum was probably a Greek invention dating back to the sixth century BC and was considered a formidable offensive weapon for centuries. Its use required an experienced captain and a disciplined crew. Other rostra have been found in the Mediterranean and are not to be confused with cutwaters, also used to damage enemy warships. The Hellenistic Athlit rostrum was found south of Haifa (Israel) in 1980 and was dated to 220 BC. Its archaeological and metallurgical analysis data, based on physico-chemical and metallographic analyses, provided unique information about bronze-casting and the construction of warships during the Hellenistic period.

    The present study is a scientific investigation of a rostrum found at a depth of 6 meters at Acqualadroni, 200 meters off the coast of Messina (Italy) in September 2008. Following its recovery, the rostrum was placed in a glass container full of demineralized water in constant flow to preserve the wooden parts.

    The Acqualadroni rostrum is a metallic artifact with a fragile wooden part from the original warship still inside it. A blackish substance is present on some areas of the wood surface. The rostrum is 162 centimeters long and weighs about 250 kilograms. The thickness of the metal is approximately 2 centimeters. The rostrum is finely decorated on both sides with very faithful drawings of two *kopis* (single-edged curved swords) and a sword similar to a Hellenistic or Greek *xiphos* (a double-edged, single-handed sword) measuring 86 and 88 centimeters, respectively. The deformation of the blade on the right-hand side is attributable to collisions with other ships. It is possible to date the rostrum on the basis of such stylistic elements. Thus, its production date may range from the fourth to the second century BC. If the rostrum dates to the third century BC, it may have been mounted on a warship used in a naval battle during the Punic Wars (e.g., the battles of the Lipari Islands and Mylae). The metallic part was investigated by the University of Palermo (CGA) using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) for lead isotope analysis. The two wooden samples were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 13C{1H} cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP MAS), NMR spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), ICP–OES, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The present investigation aims to provide information about the state of preservation of the wooden and metallic parts and to give some hints that could prove useful in conservation of the rostrum.
