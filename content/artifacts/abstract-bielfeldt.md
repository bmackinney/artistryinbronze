    A distinctive feature of Roman bronze devices is their figural idiosyncrasy: the sometimes charming, sometimes bizarre mixture of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and floral forms employed for stems, legs, handles, and bodies. Vitruvius famously criticized such fanciful visual language in the vegetabilized architectures of Roman wall-painting; what has been sidelined in the discussions on Vitruvius and the *monstra* is that the wall-paintings merely elaborated motifs long established in furniture. In scholarship on furnishings, their hybrid composition was first appreciated as delightful, and later, under the verdict of twentieth-century aesthetics, dismissed as superfluous ornamentation (“kitsch”). But it was never studied for what it can tell us about the notions associated with banquet accessories, corporeality, skillfulness, movement, and, not least, the physical energy—heat and light—produced by them.

    This paper focuses on the figural and sculptural design of floor and table candelabra as well as select lamps from Pompeii and Herculaneum, which are part of a new research and database project on Roman lighting and heating devices in bronze led by the author in collaboration with Norbert Franken (Berlin). A large number of candelabra, largely unpublished, are held by the National Museum of Naples (270 specimens). Starting from this chronologically homogenous group of lighting devices, I explore avenues toward a new conceptual framework that enables us to integrate the objects’ intriguing “sculpturalism” with other, often sundered aspects: their energy and matter (fire and metal), their production technique and functionality, their effect on space and ambience, and ultimately their precarious status as objects managed by slaves.
