&lt;p&gt;Building on a distinguished tradition, the 19th International Congress on Ancient Bronzes convened in Los Angeles between October 13 and 17, 2015. Organized by the J. Paul Getty Museum in conjunction with the Getty Conservation Institute, this meeting of more than 150 attendees was held at the Getty Center in Brentwood and the Getty Villa in Malibu. Over 5 days, 116 presenters from 24 countries participated in 11 sessions, delivering 49 papers, 3 keynote addresses, and 1 public lecture, as well as 19 posters discussing diverse aspects of ancient bronze production and its modern reception. Contributors included archaeologists, art historians, historians, curators, conservators, scientists, philologists, and experts in cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Congress was timed to coincide with the Getty’s presentation of &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World&lt;/em&gt;, an international loan exhibition that had previously opened at the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence in March 2015 and subsequently traveled to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, closing in March 2016. The exhibition was unprecedented, bringing together rare ancient bronzes from 34 museums in 13 countries on 4 continents. Focusing on bronze as a medium of artistic innovation in the period between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the establishment of the Roman Empire in 31 BC, it explored how sculptors moved beyond Classical norms, supplementing traditional subjects and idealized forms with naturalistic renderings of physical and emotional states, dynamic compositions, dazzling displays of the nude body, and graphic expressions of age and character. Divided into six sections—images of rulers; images of gods; the representation of the human body; portraiture and expression; replication; and retrospective styles—the exhibition featured exciting new finds recovered from recent excavations on both land and sea alongside famous works known for centuries, allowing for the first time significant opportunities for comparative viewing of these extraordinary works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the sculptures in the exhibition were the subject of papers presented at the Congress (and now published here), and Congress participants also took advantage of multiple visits, both formal and informal, to the Getty and other Southern California collections, as well as the exhibition itself. A special excursion was arranged to the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena and the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in nearby San Marino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Congress, of course, was in no way limited to the themes of the exhibition, with its emphasis on Hellenistic sculpture. As at previous meetings, aspects of technology and production, analytical work regarding casting cores, alloys, joins, and patinas—all of which have significantly advanced our understanding of materials, processes, and techniques involved in this medium—were addressed. Also treated were larger historiographical issues, such as how technical scholarship has impacted our understanding of bronzes within the wider history of ancient art. How do these technical data relate to our ideas of styles and development? How has bronze as a material affected ancient and modern perceptions of form, value, and the status of works of art?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These proceedings are organized along the structure and themes of the Congress itself. For mostly pragmatic reasons and to fit the requirements of the publishing format, the sequence of sections and papers during the meeting has been somewhat modified.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Where individual papers are referenced, they are identified by number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;large-scale-bronzes&#34;&gt;Large-scale Bronzes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exhibition on Hellenistic bronze sculpture installed nearby at the J. Paul Getty Museum, large-scale bronzes received particular emphasis among the papers delivered, perhaps more than in previous congresses. In this first section, several papers specifically addressed works present in the exhibition, such as the bronze athlete from Ephesos (1), the head of a man with &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; from Kalymnos (4), and the Apollo head from Salerno (6). Congress participants subsequently continued and deepened the discussions directly in front of the objects, often with great enthusiasm. This was particularly productive, as many of these conversations involved the very experts in whose care these works are entrusted, including archaeologists, curators, and conservators. (In fact, a significant factor for colleagues and their institutions in deciding to lend several of these extraordinary objects to the exhibition was the coincidence of the Congress with the exhibition, providing unique opportunities for an exchange of ideas among an international community of specialists.) The papers in this section ranged from the legendary Colossus of Rhodes (2), the largest of all large-scale bronzes but known only from ancient descriptions, to the latest underwater discoveries in the Aegean Sea (3)—many as yet unpublished—and the reception of Greek bronze sculpture in the twentieth century. Here, as in other sections, some papers were the results of close collaboration between art historians and conservators (1, 7), exemplifying a model of bronze scholarship pioneered in the 1990s by Carol Mattusch and Henry Lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-artist&#34;&gt;The Artist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artistry being the theme of the Congress, several scholars devoted their papers to the question of artists and their workshops. A proverbial 99 per cent (if not more) of large bronzes made in antiquity are irrevocably lost, so attempts to reconstruct some of that vast majority from textual, epigraphical, or other indirect evidence are inevitable and crucial for our understanding of the genre and of ancient sculpture production as a whole. Novel approaches to this old problem include an investigation of dowel holes on statue bases as indicators of technical innovations by sculptors and craftsmen (9); a prosopographical study of statue base inscriptions aiming to trace the movement of artists and markets (12); and an analysis of how natural patinas and their color impacted ancient writers’ judgment of bronze sculptures (11). The most experimental proposal, perhaps, came from a team of researchers and engineers in Japan who used 3D-shape comparison software to examine sculpted faces and reassess attributions to one particular artist, the ever-present, ever-elusive Polykleitos (10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;statuettes&#34;&gt;Statuettes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in previous congresses, the sheer quantity and wide distribution of small-scale figures invited a large number of papers and in Los Angeles these were presented in two dedicated sessions. The inquiries, approaches, and methodologies were as wide-ranging as the material itself, including aesthetic, iconographic, contextual, and technological studies. Among them are a new interpretation of the identity of the so-called Artisan in the Metropolitan Museum, which was on view in &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt; (15); a comparative investigation of enamel technology in Roman and Celtic miniature bronzes of enigmatic roosters (19); and a paper highlighting the phenomenon of medium-sized (i.e., large) statuettes (18), which may be a subset worthy of its own category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hellenistic-east&#34;&gt;The Hellenistic East&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its subtitle announced, &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt; presented bronzes from the “Hellenistic World,” which, in the wake of Alexander’s conquests, stretched far beyond the shores of the Mediterranean. Although modern geopolitical considerations precluded more than a glimpse of the large bronzes preserved from the expanded East, some of this rich material was duly covered in the exhibition catalogue. The number of Congress papers addressing bronzes in the Hellenistic East warranted a separate session. These explore bronze—and its influence on other media—from sites ranging from central Anatolia (21), Syria (23), and Iran (22) to Uzbekistan in Central Asia in the area of ancient Bactria. (An irony illustrating the truly global reach of the International Bronze Congress: of all venues in its history, Los Angeles has been the most western!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vessels&#34;&gt;Vessels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-Eastern perspectives were also present among the papers dealing with bronze vessels, be it an examination of figurative vases from Lebanon (28) or a historical study of the role Hellenistic vessels played in the origins and development of Islamic metalware (29). The Derveni Krater, the subject of a series of papers in previous congresses, has been reconfirmed as a touchstone and climax of bronze artistry of any period (26).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;artifacts&#34;&gt;Artifacts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its early days, the Bronze Congress has provided a forum not only for “major artworks” such as sculpture or elaborate vessels, but also for more mundane artifacts and implements, from armor and weaponry, lamps and mirrors, to medical instruments and even nails. One paper reminds us that as early as the Minoan period, the smallest of cosmetic devices, such as tweezers and scrapers, could in fact be status symbols (30). Similarly, bronze cases for writing and medical implements found in Hellenistic Macedonian tombs formed part of elite burials (32). Among the new material presented in this section—either unpublished or hitherto misinterpreted—were engraved bronze inlays, modest products by themselves but now understood as decorations for elaborate musical instruments (34).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conservation-and-analysis&#34;&gt;Conservation and Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the defining roles of Bronze Congresses has been as a platform for direct exchange between art historians, archaeologists, conservators, and scientists from a wide range of disciplines and specialized fields. Research presented in almost every session included projects conducted collaboratively with metal conservators and/or materials scientists. Bundled here are the manifold contributions whose main focus is on the metallurgy, chemistry, technology, or conservation of ancient bronzes. Papers and posters in this section dovetailed closely with the &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt; exhibition, discussing metal analytics and manufacturing processes of the Medici Riccardi Horse (39), Alexander on Horseback (44), the Getty Herm (41), and the Apoxyomenos statue from Croatia (43), all of which were on display in the exhibition. As critical awareness of the fallibilities in sampling and testing methods has grown over the past decades, a number of important bronzes have recently been reanalyzed, for instance the Piombino Apollo (42), whose alloy was first tested in 1967, and the Nelidow Alexander statuette (47), whose authenticity had for some time been questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the newer developments in ancient bronze studies is a heightened awareness of the limitations of the investigative tools available to us, not only their promises and opportunities. With this comes the need to accept the inconvenience that older analytical results may not be as reliable as our desire to trust “hard science” would have us believe. Thus, we have the responsibility and burden of seeking the resources, institutional support, and professional alliances to conduct new series of analyses where such investigations are warranted. In this regard, the International Bronze Congresses—being more than just a forum for scholarly exchange—can be an effective catalyst for advanced research agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the way it has evolved, the field of Ancient Bronze Studies as a whole may be recognized as a role model for other disciplines: it embraces the utmost diversity in perspectives and methodologies—practiced, shared, and adopted by experts at home in the humanities, metallurgy, and engineering as well as nuclear physics and even traditional crafts. This is in part a function of bronze being a man-made material, but it is mostly due to a culture of curiosity, openness, and innovation among bronze’s enthusiastic scholars and practitioners. Future congresses will celebrate and advance this legacy, beginning with the 20th International Congress on Ancient Bronzes planned for early 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Congress owed its success to the hard work and ingenuity of many colleagues and collaborators and the generosity of crucial supporters. Funding was provided by the Getty’s Villa Programming Committee, the Villa Council, and the Getty Conservation Institute. As organizers we are most indebted to Lisa Guzzetta, whose coordination skills and programming experience were indispensable in the preparation of the Congress and whose equanimity guaranteed that it ran smoothly. We also relied on the support of several colleagues, including James Cuno, Heather Leisy, Andrea Bestow, Lorin Green, and Danielle Espino at the Trust; Timothy Potts, Jerry Podany, Jeffrey Maish, Jeffrey Spier, Claire Lyons, Nicole Budrovich, Paige-Marie Ketner, and Emma Sachs at the Museum, and Tim Whalen, Jeanne Marie Teutonico, and Gary Mattison at the Conservation Institute. In the middle of the Congress, we imposed our large group on two neighboring institutions, namely the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena and the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino. We are extremely grateful to Carol Togneri, Gloria Williams, Emily Beeny, Elizabeth Clingerman, Catherine Hess, and Melinda McCurdy for welcoming us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The life of a congress are its papers and the discussions and debates they inspire. It was an honor to host so many distinguished colleagues on this occasion, most of whom traveled far to come to Los Angeles. Their professional enthusiasm and thoughtful, lively presentations enriched this meeting for every participant. We express our thanks to all authors and presenters. In addition, we would like to acknowledge Beryl Barr-Sharrar, Carol Mattusch, and Salvatore Siano, who agreed to present keynote addresses, and to Giorgos Koutsouflakis, who delivered a sold-out public lecture on the latest underwater discoveries in the Aegean. Their contributions, too, are published in these proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production of this digital volume—the first in the history of the Bronze Congress!—was in the expert hands of the staff at Getty Publications, in particular Kara Kirk, Karen Levine, Greg Albers, Eric Gardner, Nick Geller, Elizabeth Kahn, Leslie Rollins, and Nina Damavandi. Project editor Ruth Evans Lane forcefully tackled the multiple challenges of this undertaking, a veritable beast with many tentacles, which were untangled and tamed by Robin Ray, our competent and sympathetic copy editor. Each of them deserves an honorific bronze statue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-archaeological-background-and-history-of-the-bronze-s-classification&#34;&gt;1. Archaeological Background and History of the Bronze’s Classification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the few preserved bronze statues from antiquity, the Athlete from Ephesos is an outstanding case in several respects (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.1&lt;/strong&gt;): (1) discovered in the late nineteenth century (1896), it comes from a clear context within its ancient surrounding; (2) to this day it ranks among the most complex conservation projects ever undertaken, requiring the reassembly of more than 200 fragments; (3) with the discovery of a “twin” statue in the sea near the coast of Croatia exactly 100 years later, it has recently become part of an intriguing case study and an issue for archaeology and art history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;q-figure q-float-left&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otto Benndorf (1838–1907), professor for Classical Archaeology at the University of Vienna, began the Austrian excavations in Ephesos in 1895 with support from the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph. The focus in the early years was on major public buildings such as the Grand Theater and the so-called Harbor Baths, a spacious bath-gymnasium complex from the late first century AD.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1896 the Austrian mission unearthed the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt; of these baths, discovering a splendid marble hall with several sculptures and elements of architectural decoration.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The southwest corner of the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt; directly in front of this marble hall, although difficult to excavate due to the debris from the collapsed hall, turned out to be an important spot. It was the only section of the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt; that remained untouched after an earthquake, which is estimated to have taken place in the third century AD. In contrast, the main area of the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt; was probably first looted and then, presumably in the fifth century AD, incorporated into the late antique town, as the surprisingly well-preserved wealthy houses unearthed recently demonstrate.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Benndorf nor English archaeologist John Turtle Wood excavated in this corner in the nineteenth century because the remnants of the roof and the building structures obstructed the ongoing work.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Benndorf and his crew finally exposed the area in the early twentieth century and found a solid stone pedestal with bases and lower parts of pilasters, being part of a (mainly lost) aedicula (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.2&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;q-figure&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img  src=&#34;./figures/fig_1.02_Plattner_Gschwantler_Vak.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;1.2&#34; /&gt;

Photo: Ephesos Excavation, Austrian Archaeological Institute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of this aedicula, 234 fragments of a life-size bronze sculpture were brought to light; it was dubbed the Athlete or the “Schaber” of Ephesos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Evidently the statue had been thrown off its base and fell forward, as the feet were found nearest to the pedestal and the head was farthest away.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The wooden roof materials and the brick tiles of the hall covered the bronze fragments; marble blocks collapsed in such a way that they formed a kind of hollow, preserving the unbroken head attached to the upper part of the back (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.3&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to an &lt;em&gt;irade&lt;/em&gt; (edict) of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the Austrian ambassador, Freiherr von Calice, was allowed to choose some of the excavated finds, which were sent to Vienna as a gift from the Sultan to Emperor Franz Joseph.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Austrian Lloyd shipping company transported the sculptures, architectural elements, and small finds to Vienna in seven transports between 1896 and 1906; the fragments of the bronze athlete came to Vienna in the 1897 transport.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (From 1907 onward, a new law concerning the legal framework of preservation of antiquities promoted by Osman Hamdi Bey, founder of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, halted the export of archaeological heritage.) Today, most of the finds from Ephesos brought to Vienna are on display in the Ephesos Museum, which was opened 1978 in the former Habsburg imperial palace in Vienna.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We will discuss the reconstruction of the heavily damaged statue is greater detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After its restoration, the statue was immediately put on display, in the first exhibition of finds from Ephesos in the “Theseus Temple” in Vienna (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.4&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This “temple,” a reduced copy of the “Theseion” (Hephaistieion) in Athens, was built by Pietro di Nobile in Vienna in 1819–23 to house the famous sculpture &lt;em&gt;Theseus Fighting the Minotaur&lt;/em&gt; by Antonio Canova. After this sculpture was moved to the main staircase of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in the 1880s, the Theseus Temple was ready to house the Ephesos exhibition, which was enthusiastically received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition of the Athlete represented a triumph of restoration, carried out by sculptor Wilhelm Sturm. The technique of the restoration and Sturm’s groundbreaking approach to solving the complex three-dimensional puzzle posed by 234 bronze fragments gained international attention. For example, Sturm was invited to Greece in 1901 to consult on the restoration of the Antikythera sculptures,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; though in the end he declined to take on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Ephesian sculpture could be reconstructed, one of the major tasks was to understand the composition of the statue and to determine the position of each fragment. Benndorf provided crucial knowledge, recognizing in the well-preserved head and its position the well-known statuary type of the marble athlete in the Uffizi of Florence.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This statue stands on display today in the Galleria, with modern arms added, holding a jug. A plaster cast of this sculpture was commissioned and it served Sturm as a model for reconstructing the Ephesian Athlete.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Due to the size and deformation of the fragments as well as losses, it was not possible to resolve every aspect of position of the arms and legs or the upper body. But remarkably only about ten fragments could not be allocated to a precise position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Ephesian and the Florentine statues were understood early on to represent athletes; this was clear because the short hair, slicked to the forehead, was apparently wet from sweat. Understanding the statuary type (or an assumed Greek original) as a masterpiece of the (late) Classical period, scholars connected it to the &lt;em&gt;Apoxyomenoi&lt;/em&gt; (scrapers) mentioned in ancient literature as works of Polycleitus and his successors (see below). The concentrated gaze down toward the hands seemed to favor this interpretation. Hence the Ephesian Athlete was reconstructed as cleaning his left arm—more precisely, the back of his left hand—with a &lt;em&gt;stlengis&lt;/em&gt;, or scraper.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around the same time, in 1896, a smaller-than-life-size sculpture was found in Frascati, Italy, and soon made its way to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The statue follows the same type as the athletes from Ephesos and Florence. The importance of this find was the preserved hands of the sculpture. It became clear that the athlete is not scraping the back of his hand but rather cleaning the &lt;em&gt;stlengis&lt;/em&gt;, using the thumb of his left hand.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Benndorf mentioned this statue already in his publication of the Ephesian Athlete in 1906.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Obviously, however, it was too late to influence the restoration of the bronze statue from Ephesos: the right arm has already been mounted at an improper angle to the body. Half a century later, a major correction was made to the position of the right arm (see below). This correction also brought the fragments of the right shoulder and the upper right arm into considerably better coordination. Furthermore, the position of the arms now corresponds much better with the turn of the head.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the find situation of the Ephesian Athlete, this statue was part of the sculptural program of the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt; of the Harbor Baths.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Statues of athletes appear to have been a common sight in such contexts; for example, a scraping athlete statue is seen framed by columns and gables of *palaestra*—architecture on a series of Campana reliefs, including one preserved in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.5&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The stone socle and fragments of the pilasters of the aedicule that framed the statue remained &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;, but the narrow marble base was taken to Vienna. This base has moldings on three sides and bears an inscription on the front, of which parts of six lines are still readable (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It mentions a Tiberius Claudius Frugianus as &lt;em&gt;gymnasiarchos&lt;/em&gt; and a Tiberius Claudius [Aristion?] as &lt;em&gt;grammateus&lt;/em&gt;; these individuals are well known as donor and builder, respectively, in the late first century/beginning of second century AD. We owe the knowledge of these names and the readability of the few fragments to four other bases of the same type, also found in the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt;, naming the same officials and their dedications of further sculptures, which have not survived.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprising —and initially misleading—is the surface of the base. There are no holes or even traces thereof for fixing a sculpture on top of it. It is flat but not entirely even. Noting this fact, R. Heberdey in 1919 expressed doubt that this base carried a bronze sculpture: it lacks the characteristic holes to fix the legs by means of lead poured through the feet.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Frank Willer has recently shown, however, that over course of time different techniques were used to fix bronze sculptures onto a base.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the Roman Imperial age, a statue was more often fixed to a metal panel or base than to the stone base itself; so in the end, the sculpture was “freestanding” due to an enlarged platform.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case from Ephesos, we have the rare good fortune of having both the bronze sculpture and its corresponding base. The date of the base might even hint at the age of the statue itself, taking into consideration the relatively short lifetime of this particular corner of the Harbor Baths. Some time in the fourth century AD, the southern rooms adjacent to the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt; were modified and reused in the new &lt;em&gt;atrium thermarum Constantiniarum.&lt;/em&gt; It seems that by that time, the southwest corner of the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt; was abandoned. Hence, the earthquakes that destroyed this part of the building might have been those of the later third century AD, recorded strikingly by the destruction of the famous Slope Houses of Ephesos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:27&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Considering this, we see a timespan of less than two hundred years for the “lifetime” of the base. Taking into consideration that the technique used to make the Athlete points to the first/second century AD, it is most likely that statue and base were purposely made for display in the &lt;em&gt;palaestra&lt;/em&gt; of the Harbor Baths (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.7&lt;/strong&gt;)—until they were both buried by debris and thus no longer available for reuse or reworking.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:28&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After first assuming or rather hoping they had unearthed a “Greek original,” archaeologists soon agreed that the Ephesian Athlete must be a Roman sculpture. But even today a vivid discussion continues as to whether the statue is a copy of a Greek original or a Roman creation. The statuary type of the Ephesian Athlete is preserved in several surviving statues/torsos&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:29&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and heads.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:30&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:30&#34;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Two small-scale bronze statuettes also follow this type&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:31&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:31&#34;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: one from the Louvre differs in that the head is raised and the athlete does not look down to his hands. Depictions of the type are also preserved on Campana reliefs,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:32&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:32&#34;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as well as on gems,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:33&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:33&#34;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and even on a statuary base from the Acropolis of Athens.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:34&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:34&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite early speculation that the Ephesian Athlete was one of the two original Greek scrapers by Daidalos from Sikyon mentioned by Pliny,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:35&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:35&#34;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it was soon clear that the statue had to be dated in the Roman era. Already by 1906, Benndorf had pronounced it an “excellent copy from early Roman times.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:36&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:36&#34;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, scholars differ widely in dating the original of the type, with estimates ranging from the fourth century BC to the end of the first century AD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karin Moser von Filseck claims the Ephesian Athlete to be the link between Polykleitos and Lysippos,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:37&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:37&#34;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while Dorothea Arnold ascribes it to the second generation after Polykleitos (370–365 BC), naming—again—Daidalos from Sikyon as a possible artist.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:38&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:38&#34;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Werner Fuchs explains the type as part of the Argive-Sikyonian tradition influenced by Lysippos (340/30 BC). A. F. Stewart and Steven Lattimore think of a possible date of origin in the third century BC following Lysippos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:39&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:39&#34;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Erwin Pochmarski, finally, proposes an Imperial original in Rome (eclectisistic?) from which a direct copy was taken.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40&#34;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the “twin” of the Ephesian Athlete, the Apoxyomenos from Lošinj, Croatia,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:41&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:41&#34;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; brought renewed attention to the Ephesian Athlete.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:42&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:42&#34;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For the first time, it is possible to compare two bronze statues of the same type found in completely different circumstances and regions of the Mediterranean. It also proves, finally, the correct reconstruction of the Ephesian Athlete. The technical aspects of both statues seem to be quite similar, which leads to the assumption that both statues are Roman Imperial, probably from the same decades. The mounting of the head, for example, is consistent in both sculptures with the characteristic V-shaped lower edge of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall impression differs, though: the Ephesian Athlete seems to be slightly more muscular. Of course, fixing 234 fragments causes as many joints, perhaps “inflating” the chest to a certain degree. However, this is not enough to explain these differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity of seeing the two statues next to each other in the exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt; at the Getty Museum, Los Angeles, led the focus of investigation back to the ancient techniques of bronze casting and joining of separate sections, but it also invited new art-historical discussion. In the catalogue to the exhibition, this type of athlete is suggested as coming from the &lt;em&gt;officina&lt;/em&gt; of Lysippos&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:43&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:43&#34;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or—more loosely—to be understood as arising in the environment of Polykleitos, Daidalos, or Lysippos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:44&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:44&#34;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracing a possible Greek original must be reconsidered in light of the different proportions and details of the two statues. Is it by chance that so many bronze specimens of this very type are preserved? In addition to the statues from Ephesos and Lošinj, the head now in the Kimbell Art Museum&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:45&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:45&#34;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and even the basanite torso from Castel Gandolfo might be taken into consideration, as the material probably is meant to resemble bronze. The issue of the main view axis—determining the “front side” of the statue—can also be revisited with new evidence. The Campana reliefs show the athlete from the side, making his movement clearly understandable. In contrast, the preserved rectangular base plate from the Croatian athlete suggests a frontal view of the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-restoration-history-and-stability-evaluation&#34;&gt;2. Restoration History and Stability Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconstruction of the Roman bronze statue was realized in Vienna in 1897–98 by the sculptor Wilhelm Sturm. He constructed an internal armature of tinned iron, brass bars, and screws to mount the 234 preserved fragments. The original fragments underwent several mechanical and chemical treatments, as was common at that time. Sturm used magnesium chloride containing mortar as a filler medium and stabilizer. During the first exhibition, this hygroscopic material caused problems of efflorescence due to temperature and humidity fluctuations; the Athlete was then moved to a better protected indoor location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following eight decades, sculptors undertook two larger interventions. In 1951 the position of the right arm was corrected, and in 1977 synthetic resin was added as a new filling material. It is important to study this restoration history and conserve the treatments as far as possible. To dispel all doubts concerning the stability and strength of the interior armature or the possibility of active corrosion on the original bronze fragments, the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna, together with the J. Paul Getty Museum,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:46&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:46&#34;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; undertook scientific investigations to characterize and evaluate the mortar chemically and structurally (mortar samples, X-radiography, endoscopic studies). Black-and-white images from 1898—taken before the mortar was poured inside the reconstructed statue—were helpful in gaining information about the condition of the original fragments and evaluating changes in comparison with the current X-ray images. For the transport of the Athlete, a “cage” of aluminum tubes, square in section, with a custom-fit interior design was developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper will present the remarkable reassembling of the bronze statue known as the Athlete of Ephesus at the end of the nineteenth century as well as the interventions in the twentieth century. The study of the different restoration treatments has revealed an interesting and complex history. Because of the diversity of materials involved, scientific investigations were necessary to evaluate the stability of the statue as it is preserved today. The first series of analyses was started 15 years ago; recent research has focused on corrosion, the composition and quality of the filling mortar, and possible changes. In 2013, a collaborative project established between the Collection of Greek and Roman Antiquities of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna and the J. Paul Getty Museum was launched to support this work as well as for the design and development of a novel transport cage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archival photographs exist (see &lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.2&lt;/strong&gt;) that show us the condition of the head right after the discovery of the Athlete in 1896.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:47&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:47&#34;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We see hard incrustations of sand and soil especially in the hair and on the forehead. No heavy corrosion or weakness of the metal is visible. However, the entire statue was broken into fragments. The heavy marble block that fell on the legs and lower part of the back caused deformation and loss of several pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reassembly of the 234 bronze fragments was a great challenge for Sturm, who was then head of the restoration studio of the antiquities department.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:48&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:48&#34;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Working together with his son, Sturm followed the then-standard practice for the treatment of outdoor bronze objects. He did not solder the fragments together, as he would have done with sound material. Instead, he reassembled them mechanically. Using more than 1,800 small brass screws, he connected 300 brass straps to the reverse side of the 234 fragments.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:49&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:49&#34;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In this way he managed to slot together the edges of the bronze as tightly as possible, with the reference statue from Florence in mind (see above).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:50&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:50&#34;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He completed the statue by mounting brass clasps to connect the two fragment assemblies to a tin-plated iron armature, giving them a rigid structure. The cleaned fragments weighed 85 kilograms (187 lbs.) (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.8&lt;/strong&gt;). In order to fill the losses and to stabilize this very fragile framework, he filled the interior up to the cranium with a mortar mixture “of his own invention.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:51&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:51&#34;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was based upon magnesium chloride, also known as Sorel cement. According to Sturm’s son and assistant, there were several advantages to using this material:&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:52&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:52&#34;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it was (1) lightweight; (2) believed to be free of hygroscopic properties; (3) absolutely stable; and (4) easy to model and to pigment to resemble bronze. Sturm remodeled the three missing fingers of the left hand, recasting them in bronze; only the thumb and ring finger are original (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.9&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know today, this mortar (containing magnesium salts) is extremely sensitive to moisture.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:53&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:53&#34;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the nineteenth century, it was only used indoors, as a very durable and long-lasting material for floors. Crucial in Sturm´s decision to use this particular mortar were probably its limited weight, its superb adhesion and binding power, and its rapid setting time of 30–45 minutes. Also, it is easy to grind and highly polishable. Presumably, he was aware of the basic principles set forth at the first international congress of art history held in Vienna 1873.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:54&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:54&#34;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A full section was dedicated to restoration issues, proclaiming: “We demand conservation, not restoration!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Sturm’s interventions, is there is any chance we can find residues of the original surface? His cleaning was achieved by reduction: Sturm used diluted hydrochloric acid, neutralized in 1% potash solution and stabilized in repeatedly changing baths of distilled water. To remove harder crusts, he annealed the pieces “softly” in an iron pan filled with charcoal.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:55&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:55&#34;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In this context, “softly” probably means tempering the bronze fragments. The aim was to relax the inner structure of the metal and deliberately to soften the metal, making it easier to reshape the deformed fragments. Since there is evidence in the records that the surface color changed after this treatment,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:56&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:56&#34;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; we must assume that there is little if any original surface left. We know for sure that Sturm mechanically removed the residues on the head and the hair with hammer and punches. The bronze surface was painted over with vinegar and later, to stop the oxidation, brushed with beeswax (wiping with neat’s-foot oil or olive oil was also very common &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:57&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:57&#34;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.10&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the first exhibition of the freshly restored Athlete in the Theseus temple in 1901, the person in charge complained about efflorescence appearing on the bronze surface.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:58&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:58&#34;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Due to the fluctuating temperature and humidity from the outside, combined with the presence of a damp wine cellar below, the bronze had started to corrode. Ten years after the first exhibition, after repeated complaints and an expert opinion from Sturm Junior,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:59&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:59&#34;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the statue was removed, probably cleaned, and newly waxed or oiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two further restorations or interventions are documented. First, in 1951, Karl Nieschlag,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:60&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:60&#34;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; an academic sculptor and stage designer who held an Austrian state award for music, was commissioned to follow Fritz Eichler’s proposal to change the position of the right arm (see above).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:61&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:61&#34;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He removed the mortar of the upper arm, shortened the main iron rod by sawing off 1 centimeter (0.4 inches), and cut three brass straps.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:62&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:62&#34;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Using a short piece of iron, he welded the armature together again. Nieschlag completed the restoration with a new, pigmented mortar addition; we can see additional winding wire for fixing this mortar (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.11&lt;/strong&gt;). He also filled cracks that had developed during transport or earlier, and he finished the surface treatment with a new wax coating. Nevertheless, he could not avoid producing new cracks. Second, in 1976, Alois Heidl,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:63&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:63&#34;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; an academic sculptor and student of Fritz Wotruba,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:64&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:64&#34;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; executed the most recent restoration of the Athlete. He removed parts of the mortar on the right calf including bronze fragments and gave the surface a new shape. Heidl worked large parts of the surface, leaving Nieschlag’s supplement almost untouched. He covered the bigger areas of the old mortar filling, like the upper back, the stomach, and the thighs, by modeling a pigmented synthetic resin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering the transport of the Athlete from Vienna to California for the exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:65&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:65&#34;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; concerns arose about stability and strength of the internal framework and the mortar fill. Had the hygroscopic nature of the Sorel cement caused active corrosion on the inside of the ancient bronze as well as on the iron rod? Was the cement itself porous and inhomogeneous and was volume expansion a dangerous issue? In collaboration with the Getty Museum’s Department of Antiquities Conservation, samples of the Sorel cement were analyzed,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:66&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:66&#34;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; confirming that the Vienna statue, despite its well-known instabilities, does not show evidence of current or past corrosion problems in the accessible areas.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:67&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:67&#34;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The mortar mixture is loaded with inert sand, and this highly porous mixture gives enough space for potential volume expansion. Inspection with a video borescope through one of the Athlete’s eyes showed no active corrosion on the inner surface of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1900 several investigations have been executed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronze:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1900&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:68&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:68&#34;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: Fusing analysis: 89% Cu, 6% Sn, 4.8% Pb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2002&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:69&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:69&#34;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: µ-RFA: polished surface: 84–88% Cu, 7–9% Sn, 4.5–7.7% Pb; corroded surface: 45–60% Cu, 7–14% Sn, 25–39% Pb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complement the X-radiography studies of the BAM&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:72&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:72&#34;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; performed in Berlin 2001 (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.12&lt;/strong&gt;), the Austrian Technical Inspection Authority (TÜV) provided their portable X-ray apparatus. Radiography images, produced by selenium-isotope continuous radiation, yielded additional information about the porosity and the structural distribution of the Sorel cement. For this investigation, the radiation had to reach as far as 40 meters (44 yards), a difficult task to organize in the Neue Burg, the spacious building where the Athlete is on display in the Ephesos Museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under X-radiation, the chest of the Athlete showed very high density with almost no detectable penetration, even after doubling the radiation’s intensity and prolonging the exposure time fourfold. A possible reason could be the high concentration of barite&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:73&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:73&#34;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the fill, but a conclusive explanation is still lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New information enabled us to detect the traces of interventions (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.13&lt;/strong&gt;), the distribution of the mortar inside the sculpture, and the thickness and position of the individual bronze fragments. Equally important for the final interpretation were the black-and-white images taken in 1898, showing the reconstructed Athlete without the mortar fill. Using these images for comparison with the X-ray images taken in 2013, we were able to gain essential new information regarding construction changes, fragment position, and visible facture lines (&lt;strong&gt;figs. 1.14–15&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, a three-dimensional model of the Athlete was generated to build the custom cage for transport.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:74&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:74&#34;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Our colleagues at the Getty Museum developed the aluminum structure (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 1.16&lt;/strong&gt;), which allowed the entire weight of the cage and the statue to be supported by the fillet of the base. An accurately fitting, two-piece counterpart made of epoxy resin was mechanically connected with the aluminum construction and the pallet. To keep the statue stable inside the cage, aluminum crossbeams were screwed onto the scaffolding. Customized designs were cut out of an inert foam and applied to the beams in order to supply soft but rigid and sufficient support to the Athlete.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:75&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:75&#34;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For vibration control, a pre-calculated amount of special shock-absorbing material was placed between the inner and the outer crate, absorbing fully 93% of shock, as confirmed by vibration measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

Dieser Schenkung solle hier aus dem Grund gedacht werden, weil sie zu Beginn des Jahres 1897 nach Wien gelangt und die allerhöchste Annahme in diesem Jahr erfolgt ist. Die Zusammensetzung der Bruchstücke ist aber unterbrochen worden teils durch Abwarten, ob die im Herbst 1897 fortgesetzten Ausgrabungen noch fehlende Fragmente bringen möchten, teils durch das verzögerte Eintreffen eines Gipsabgusses der Florentiner Athletenstatue, die als Modell für die Zusammensetzung der Bruchstücke unseres bronzenen Athleten dienen soll. Die Marmorskulpturen scheinen der römischen Kaiserzeit anzugehören, während die Epoche der Entstehung der Bronzestatue noch einen Gegenstand der Erörterung in den Fachkreisen bildet.” (ZL AS 9, Jan. 28, 1898).

      <title>Was the Colossus of Rhodes Cast in Courses or in Large Sections?</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the argument over where the monumental statue known as the Colossus of Rhodes was located, its casting has hitherto seldom been considered. The statue—made of cast bronze with a height of 70 cubits (30–35 meters, or 98–114 feet)—must have left at least some remnants of its production. Furthermore, these remnants must be discoverable in the city of Rhodes. However, a requirement for recognizing these remnants is knowledge of the casting technique that was used. For this reason, it is worth undertaking a reconstruction of the manufacturing process of this lost statue.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philo of Byzantium (&lt;em&gt;De septem mundi miraculis&lt;/em&gt; 4) wrote the longest text describing bronze casting to survive from antiquity, and also left a description of a casting technique said to have been used for the Colossus.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; His text has been given a lot of authority in our scholarly tradition. In this paper, a more analytic approach is taken: it is a technical-archaeological commentary on the text by Philo, verifying whether the details he mentioned are compatible with the ancient situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philo claims that the Colossus was cast in a different way than normal statues. He explains: “For the individual metal sections could not be moved.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But given that the monumental architraves of the Hellenistic temples in Asia Minor are heavier than any large bronze piece, this is clearly not true.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Further, he writes: “after the first part had been cast, the second was modeled upon it, and for the following part again the same method of working was adopted&amp;hellip; . After the casting of the new course upon that part of the work already completed&amp;hellip; . the artist heaped up a huge mound of earth round each section as soon as it was completed, thus burying the finished work under the accumulated earth, and carrying out the casting of the next part on the level.” Thus, according to Philo, the Colossus of Rhodes was cast &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; in horizontal courses buried gradually by an earthen embankment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a lot of bronze workshops on Rhodes have been uncovered and provide good information about the casting process used on the island at the time of the Colossus.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They prove that, contrary to Philo’s report, colossal statues were cast in large sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest known casting pit was excavated at the southern slope of the acropolis in the city of Rhodes, on the Mylonas property. It was part of a workshop that operated at the beginning of the third century BC, the time when the Colossus was manufactured. It measures at its center 7 meters long and 3.25 meters wide and it is 3.6 meters deep (22 x 11 x 12 feet). Zimmer reconstructed in it a colossal upper part of a male body.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thus he proved the existence of tall statues cast in large sections up to 15 meters (49 feet) high. This is an archaeological proof, as no statue of these dimensions has survived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the Colossus of Rhodes—a statue twice the size of the one Zimmer reconstructed—also have been cast in large pieces? How realistic is the method described by Philo? As no ancient examples remain, two extant colossal bronzes will help to answer these questions. They provide the general parameters of the working process and the keywords to be searched for in the ancient literary sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and older of the two was brought into the discussion by D. Haynes in 1992.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Great Buddha Vairocana in the Todaiji monastery in Nara (Japan) is 14.96 meters (49 feet) high and was manufactured in 743–757 AD.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The statue was cast in a method similar to that described by Philo and proves that this method is technically possible. The second statue, the &lt;em&gt;Bavaria&lt;/em&gt; at the Ruhmeshalle was completed between 1837 and 1850 in Munich.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Its large cast pieces were assembled into a figure 18.52 meters (60 feet) tall. These sculptures, though enormous, are roughly half the size of the Colossus. As a sitting figure, the Buddha at least has similar proportions to the standing Colossus. Contemporary documents relating to the manufacturing process exist for both the Buddha and the &lt;em&gt;Bavaria&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five working steps are necessary for both life-sized statues and for extremely large-scale statues such as the Buddha and the &lt;em&gt;Bavaria&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;first working step&lt;/em&gt; is the construction and modeling of the master model. Colossal statues need a model with the same dimensions as the bronze statue to be cast. And the Colossus of Rhodes was no exception, as illustrated in the author’s schematic drawing (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 2.1&lt;/strong&gt;). The master model provides certainty that the statics of the statue are well done and that after assembly the large sections will fit together.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;q-figure&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img  src=&#34;./figures/fig_2.01_Vedder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;2.1&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bavaria&lt;/em&gt; and the Buddha both had a master model, consisting of a wooden scaffold covered with materials to provide a surface for modeling in clay. A wood sheathing for this purpose is recorded in Munich. In Nara, the walling of the model still consists of wood, linen, and clay. In both cases, completion of the master model took several years of the decade or more it took to complete the statue. A Japanese text records 426 days just to model the clay for the Buddha.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The master model of the Buddha remained inside the statue, forming its core. Of relevance here is the fact that it was built around a central mast of the same height as the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of master models in antiquity is proven by the monumental chryselephantine statues of the fifth century BC. Consider, for example, the Athena Parthenos, 26 cubits (ca. 13 meters) high, which was in effect a master model covered with precious materials. Traces of her base are preserved in the Parthenon. In its naos, a hole still is visible where the central mast of her scaffold was affixed. Thus its construction was similar to that of the Buddha in Nara.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pheidias, the master of the Parthenos, also made the Athena Promachos, which stood on the Acropolis near the Parthenon. The statue was made of cast bronze, and its height is believed to have been between 9 and 15 meters (29–49 feet).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is notable that the ground plan of the statue’s base again has a hole in the center (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 2.2&lt;/strong&gt;). Following the arguments of Palagia, the statue was cast in the same period as the Parthenos was manufactured. The Promachos was dedicated to the main deity of the polis of Athens and stood in her sanctuary. Thus the Promachos is a real predecessor of the Colossus of Rhodes. Pheidias built a scaffold in the location of the bronze statue in order to make the master model for the Promachos. Afterward the statue was cast in pieces on the south side of the Acropolis. The finished parts were brought up to the Acropolis and assembled on the base instead of on the master model. Thus for colossal statues with a height up to 15 meters, we have not only archaeological remains of casting pits but also references concerning the master model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;q-figure&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img  src=&#34;./figures/fig_2.02_Vedder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;2.2&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;q-figure-label&#34;&gt;Figure 2.2.&lt;/span&gt; Ground plan of the platform for the pedestal of the Athena Promachos in Athens (drawing by T. Tanoulas, Palagia 2013, fig. 11)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philo does not mention the master model of the Colossus. But the master model of the Colossus commissioned by Nero for his &lt;em&gt;Domus Aurea&lt;/em&gt; in Rome is probably the subject of a half sentence in Pliny (&lt;em&gt;Naturalis historia&lt;/em&gt; 34.45–46). If this was indeed the subject, it was constructed and cast imitating the Rhodian prototype.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it can be proved that the Rhodians not only had the technological skills to cast colossal statues but were also able to build a sophisticated timber structure. Such a timber structure was known to be present in Rhodes when the Colossus was planned: the war machine &lt;em&gt;Helepolis&lt;/em&gt; was built by order of Demetrios Poliorketes during the unsuccessful siege of Rhodes in 304/303 BC and was left behind when he quit the island. Ancient sources record its height as between 86 and 100 cubits (44–50 meters, or 144–164 feet). According to Pliny (&lt;em&gt;Naturalis historia&lt;/em&gt; 34.41), it was sold to make the Colossus, the dedication to Helios after the victory. Perhaps the Rhodians used even its timbers to construct the master model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;second working step&lt;/em&gt; was to make the casting molds. For all casting methods, it is common for workers to prepare the mold and the core so as to fashion a cavity for the thickness of the bronze wall, which will then filled with the molten metal. In antiquity, beeswax was used for this purpose, giving the name to the “lost wax method.” Details of this process need not be repeated here.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan they used neither wax nor clay to create the cavity for the Buddha. Over three thousand bronze pins with heads about 3 centimeters thick and 12 centimeters square were fabricated and hammered into the surface of the master model. The thickness of the pinheads determined how much of the clay surface needed do be reduced in order to provide the cavity for the bronze. The pins remained in place, becoming part of the statue’s walling, and are visible today (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 2.3&lt;/strong&gt;). The reduced surface of the master model was burned out by fire, thus transforming the master model into the core of a casting form. Around this core, the walling of the statue was cast in six layers, as seen in the schematic drawing at &lt;strong&gt;figure 2.4&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;q-figure&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img  src=&#34;./figures/fig_2.03_Vedder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;2.3&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;q-figure-label&#34;&gt;Figure 2.3.&lt;/span&gt; Statue of Buddha Vairocana in the Todaiji Temple, Nara, Japan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;q-figure&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img  src=&#34;./figures/fig_2.04_Vedder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; id=&#34;2.4&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;q-figure-label&#34;&gt;Figure 2.4.&lt;/span&gt; Buddha of Nara, reconstruction of the casting mold. (The drawing is a copy of Maeda et al. 1997, fig. 55, omitting Japanese characters and adding numbers and English text)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddha of Nara proves that the casting method described by Philo is technically feasible. But in important details, such as master model and the use of wax, the description is incomplete and unreliable. Philo also neglects to mention the making of a core. Instead he describes an armature in the inside of the statue, growing higher with every cast course. Hence the inside was thought to be open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot have worked like that. Without a master model, it would have been impossible to form the course of a statue on the finished section covered with earth. And a sculptor’s copy cage to scale up the object, as Maryon proposed, is not feasible.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, this technique, though used by Roman portrait sculptors, was unknown in the early third century BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to our other analog in Munich, the &lt;em&gt;Bavaria&lt;/em&gt; was cast in large sections, so the master model was cut into numerous pieces (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 2.5&lt;/strong&gt;). The largest of these are marked in &lt;strong&gt;figure 2.6&lt;/strong&gt;. The fabrication of mold and core was done according to the “sand-casting process,” in which the fabricators used a special sand—a mixture of fire-resistant soils fixed by plaster—instead of clay. Instead of wax, clay sheets were used. And whereas in antiquity the system of funnels, gates, and vents was distributed regularly over the body, in Munich the funnel system was manufactured only above the mold. The channels for the vents were fixed at the lower edge of the mold at the bottom of the casting pit. Mold and core were built up from the bottom of the casting pit in such a way that no chaplets were needed. As illustrated in &lt;strong&gt;figure 2.7&lt;/strong&gt;, the sections of the core can still be seen in the statue’s interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;third working step&lt;/em&gt; is the melting of the bronze alloy and casting. These processes are not mentioned by Philo. It seems that he did not understand that Greek melting ovens were small.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The earthen hill for casting would have to have been more than 70 cubits high, and had to have provided a large surface with space for a great many casting ovens and workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In eighth-century Japan, the ovens were larger and took up less space. Both the oven and the mud-brick hill are proved by archaeological finds. In nineteenth-century Munich, they were able to build an oven large enough to melt the metal for one large section at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working step four&lt;/em&gt; is the treatment of the bronze surface after casting. Casting a large bronze in large sections means that the treatment of the bronze surface can be done at the same time as the preparation for the casting of other pieces. In this case, &lt;em&gt;working step five&lt;/em&gt;, the mounting of the finished pieces, is the last step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese workers, by contrast, had to wait until the casting of the head was complete. Only then could they begin with the removal of the mud-brick hill, the molds, and the surface treatment of the bronze. The mud brick was later spread in the terrain, an important detail for our context: there are no reported finds in Rhodes that can be connected with an artificial hill 35 meters (114 feet) high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another detail is not comparable: in Nara, surviving documents indicate that 8,000 workers and 200 overseers worked on the Buddha project. It is unlikely that there were that many workers in the Greek context at the beginning of the third century BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summing up, the technique described by Philo is not compatible with the situation proved by archaeology in ancient Greece. An explanation for this discrepancy might be that his text is not a factual account but rather a reconstruction of the casting of the Colossus. The text, or an earlier source from which it was compiled, was written because the original information from the third century BC—the time of Chares of Lindos, the sculptor of the Colossus—was lost. Thus we need no longer credit the idea that the Colossus of Rhodes was cast using a different technique from that attested on Rhodes. The statue must have been cast in large sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understanding leads to the following points useful in the search for the location of the statue and its workshop on Rhodes. We are looking for a workshop in which an extremely large figure was cast in large sections. I believe it was situated near the statue’s base, with space for a workshop to be built and used over long working period (Pliny &lt;em&gt;Naturalis historia&lt;/em&gt; 34.41 suggests twelve years).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The statue base had dimensions comparable to those of the surviving base of the Colossus of Nero (17.60 x 14.75 meters, or 58 x 48 feet). It was used first for the construction and modeling of the master model and then for the finished statue. The casting pits were nearby. They were not necessarily oval, and were wider but not deeper than the pits already known.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 I published a proposal for the possible location of the Colossus’s base and workshop in the sanctuary of Helios above the stadium and the odeion on the acropolis of Rhodes (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 2.8)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The ruin northeast of the temple may be the remains of the base and the workshop. In the discussion of this interpretation of the ruin, the casting technique of the Colossus plays an important role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank God for Vesuvius; thank God for shipwrecks.” Bondo Wyszpolski’s comment&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on the exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World&lt;/em&gt; at the Getty Museum accurately sums up an art-historical reality: bronze artwork of antiquity rarely survived the vicissitudes of history, except by mere chance. The contribution of Pompeii together with a handful of other sites is well known and recognized; the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum, for example, with its exquisite bronze portraiture “catapulted the study of bronzes from antiquarian pastime to art-historical discipline,”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; presenting an excellent archaeological context in which the Hellenistic art of portraiture could be well appreciated and understood. By contrast, the yield from the depths of the sea covers a considerably longer time span and is mostly the result of unintentional acts, resulting in a testimony that is far more ambiguous. The pursuit of context remains a major issue for most bronzes recovered underwater.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Basin forms the largest reservoir of bronze statuary, and a kind of reservoir that will not run out any time soon. Scholars tend to link the bronzes recovered from the sea to shipwrecks, dated to the late Republican and early Imperial periods. This notion, often perceived as true &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, is contingent upon a perceptual framework that dominated scholarly thought for more than a century. Yet, after a hundred years of underwater research, examples of solid shipwrecks carrying bronzes are very few, with a large number of “ghost-wrecks” remaining evasive and tenaciously resisting discovery. This very fact reveals one of the weaknesses of early discoveries: while much ink has been spilled over-analyzing styles, musculature, drapery, and rendering, the exact locations where those masterpieces were found are poorly documented and have fallen into oblivion. Those infinitesimal details that could lead directly to the find spots were left unpublished, because they were regarded as either unimportant or self-evident. Furthermore, recent finds suggest a much more nuanced story in the dating of bronzes loaded on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipwrecks do indeed present evidence for the advance of archaeological studies that no other terrestrial or underwater site can possibly provide. They offer an opportunity to trace the nexuses between trade, trade routes, commercial strategies, shipping, and ship-management. But doubtless their most salient quality is the range of intact artifacts they provide in connection with their existence &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; in space and time. As self-contained and self-organized units, they offer a unique possibility to study bronzes in a transitional context, completely independent of the historical topography of terrestrial sites. This “disconnected reasoning” is well appreciated by scholars, who are often inclined to dovetail wrecks with certain historical events recorded in written sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although underwater archaeology as an open-water activity was initiated in the Aegean in the nineteenth century, certain discoveries were made even earlier, when the sea was still considered insurmountable. Bronze statues were traditionally raised from the sea by fishermen dragging their nets. This phenomenon, as old as some of the raised statues themselves, was illustrated for the first time on a relief from Ostia, found in the vicinity of the temple of Hercules and dated round 70 BC (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.1&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Commissioned and dedicated to the temple by the haruspex Caius Fulvius Salvis, the relief depicts six fishermen pulling up a supernatural statue of Hercules Promachos in their net. It is not well understood if the episode depicted is an accident or a deliberate act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest reported example of a bronze statue raised by nets in the Aegean is the “Berlin Youth” or “Apollo,” a headless corpus of a youth dated in the late first century BC, said to have been retrieved by Italian fishermen from the sea off Salamis in the Saronic Gulf in 1878.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Very little is known about the circumstances of the discovery. The youth passed into the Sabouroff collection and in 1884 was acquired by the Antikensammlung in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later, in 1899, a bronze statue of another god was discovered in the shallows of the modern village of Agios Vasileios, in southern Boeotia, affixed to an inscribed base that identified the figure as Poseidon.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The statue, dated in the very late Archaic period and restored in the 1970s, was placed on permanent display in the Athens Archaeological Museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the Antikythera wreck discovered shortly thereafter, in 1900, is well known.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Greek state, though on the verge of bankruptcy and just recovering from war, nevertheless undertook and completed one of the most remarkable archaeological operations ever. Thanks to a group of sponge divers from the island of Sími, most of the wreck’s cargo was raised, bringing to light some of the most dazzling masterpieces of ancient sculpture. This historic research opened a long archaeological dialogue, renewed several times during the twentieth century and prolonged well into the twenty-first. Apart from leading the way and triggering the underwater excavation of the Mahdia wreck several years later, the Antikythera wreck demonstrated for the first time the potential of underwater archaeological research. The site remains under investigation 115 years after it was first discovered: no other project undertaken by the Hellenic Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities has been more time-consuming in organization, more complex in application, more demanding in resources, and more celebrated by the press than the “Return to Antikythera” project, the first attempt to reevaluate this historic shipwreck and excavate it according to modern procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resonance of the 1901 research did not last long, however. Technological limitations, ignorance, and a series of unfortunate international circumstances seriously affected any further steps toward establishing a discipline. For the following half-century, shipwrecks were considered suitable only for salvage operations: any other retrieval from the sea remained accidental until the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the recovery of some of the most famous masterpieces of art worldwide is dated to this early twentieth-century period. In June 1925 a complete bronze statue of a youth known as the “Marathon Boy” was raised during a fishing operation in the southern Euboean Gulf. Konstantinos Rhomaios, to whom the piece was handed in the port of Rafina, was not keen to delve deep into the details of the discovery: he contented himself with the information provided. “The statue was found,” he writes, “in the Marathon Bay, between the coast and some tiny island.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The information was never cross-checked, although he reports that there was evidence available from other eye-witnesses. The nickname &lt;em&gt;agalma&lt;/em&gt; (statue) was adopted among the local fishermen to define the find spot. Ironically enough, the nickname survived in records and lists of toponyms, but there is no living memory of where it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those three statues—the Berlin Youth, the Poseidon, and the Marathon Boy—were all single objects retrieved from the sea and lacking a definite context. The obvious and most self-evident reasoning—that they once belonged to the cargo of ships that never reached port—was generally accepted without further investigation. This is not however the only reasoning. Even Rhomaios in his 1925 report remained circumspect in recognizing a wreck under every statue raised from the sea.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, a large number of excerpts culled from ancient writers declare that ancient bronzes could have been submerged underwater in antiquity for a variety of reasons. They could result from an act of “dumping” or jettison (the legal term for goods or equipment thrown overboard from a ship when in danger); from geophysical phenomena (earthquakes, inundations, etc.); or from an official symbolic condemnation of the memory of a certain person (&lt;em&gt;damnatio memoriae&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; “Dumping” or jettison, no doubt, was a common practice, since it was expedient to heave things overboard when a ship was in danger. References to jettison of all kinds abound in ancient sources,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and we can assume that the things dumped into the sea were the heaviest on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Antikythera, the first bronzes directly linked to a shipwreck came from the sea off Artemision, the narrow strait separating Euboea from the Pagasetic Gulf, and once the site of a famous sea battle between the Persians and the Greeks.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The first piece to be drawn up in fishing nets in 1926 was the left forearm of Zeus of Artemision, one of the most celebrated works of ancient Greek art.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The find was reported to the Department of Antiquities, and initially no further action was taken. Two years later, in September 1928, a boat was reported to be performing illicit salvage operations in the same area. Concerted action led to the investigation of the suspected boat and confiscation of a newly broken right arm of a statue. A heavy cable was attached at that very moment to something that the divers and crew were about to pull up. Over the next few days, the authorities towed the remaining body of Zeus ashore onto the beach of Pefki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident triggered outrage among the press and the public, who reprimanded the Department for its idleness. Pressure mounted to undertake a more intensive investigation of the site. A new mission was pioneered by the &lt;em&gt;ephor&lt;/em&gt; (magistrate) Nikos Vertos, an enthusiastic land archaeologist, who however could not dive and therefore could not be directly involved in underwater work. Diving in those days was still difficult and dangerous, and archaeologists could not possibly meet the demands of such operations. To quote a passage from George Bass, they “stayed instead on deck and gratefully accepted the artifacts handed up to them by hired divers.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The exclusion of scholars from the finds’ archaeological context had a serious impact on our understanding of early shipwrecks. Yet Vertos’s official report, precise in its facts and accurate in its diction, remains today the main source of information regarding the Artemision shipwreck. The expedition lasted less than three weeks and was undertaken at the wrong time of the year, and thus confronted extreme weather conditions. The divers unearthed and pulled up the forepart of the body of a horse and the statue of a small boy. A short expedition resumed work in the spring of 1929, before the project ended due to the lack of adequate diving equipment. Efforts to locate the rear part of the horse failed, and Vertos insinuated that the piece had been washed away into a deep channel. This missing part appeared several years later, in 1936, caught by fishing nets in a spot several kilometers west of the wreck site, near the town of Oreoi. Even at such an early stage of underwater investigation, there was clear evidence of a fact that would prove an on-going issue even seven decades later: bronzes discovered underwater, no matter how heavy, tend to get dismembered and separated from their post-depositional context as result of secondary human action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no official record indicating that anyone saw the wreck site again, and all later attempts to relocate the site—by Jacques Yves Cousteau (1976, 1982), Willard Bascom (1993), and Shelley Wachsmann (2006)—failed to yield any results. Details or schedules about the exact find-spot again are lacking in the archives. Probably the site was silted over without leaving visible remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statue of the Horse and Jockey was reassembled, and after extensive restoration went on display at the National Museum of Athens.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The original artist and the circumstances under which the work was created are unknown. Seán Hemingway has suggested that it may have been plundered from Corinth in 146 BC by the Roman general Mumius during the Achaean War and given to Attalus as a share of the booty, but lost while in transit to Pergamon.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Christos Piteros connected the wreck with the plundering of Chalkis by Mithridates’ general Archelaos after the defeat of their coalition by Sulla in 86 BC and his escape back to Pergamon.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the delivery of the last part of the Artemision assemblage, almost half a century passed without any significant new finds in Greece. The only exception was the confiscation by the port police of a bronze statuette depicting Artemis, raised during illegal operations in 1959 from the sea off Mykonos (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.2&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; According to the statue’s drapery and style, it should be dated in the early Hellenistic period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several bronzes have however been reported found off the coast of Asia Minor, modern Turkey. The “Lady from the Sea” was found in 1953 by fishermen dragging their nets along the coast of Arap Adasi, not far from the Knidos peninsula, at a depth of around 100 meters (330 feet).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They brought the bronze to the village of Bitez, near Bodrum, and abandoned it on the beach. There, neglected and covered with marine incrustations, it remained for several weeks until it attracted the attention of George E. Bean, a British professor at Istanbul University; he had the bronze removed to Izmir where it was cleaned and housed. The work is usually dated in the first half of the third century BC. Extensive underwater surveys conducted in the area failed to link the bronze to any specific context.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, in 1963, the half-broken bronze statue of a young African was pulled from the sea by sponge-draggers at a depth of 100 meters (330 feet), not far from the modern city of Bodrum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Preserved from the hips up and retaining both arms, it might represent a groom and might have been part of a Hellenistic honorary monument. A bronze figurine of Isis-Fortuna was netted in the same area that same year, leaving open a hypothesis that both works may have originated from the same wreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest reported statue from the coast of Turkey is the life-size bronze of a runner discovered at the Bay of Nemrut, near the ancient city of Cyme (Kyme).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The work represents an athlete, probably the victor of a footrace. Somewhat awkwardly composed and schematically muscled, he is remarkable for the individual features of the face. It is evidently a portrait, but it might also echo a famous high Classical statue, Myron’s &lt;em&gt;Ladas&lt;/em&gt;, which inspired numerous epigrams praising its sense of swiftness; this work has unfortunately not survived, even in replica. The face’s individuality and hairstyle suggest a late Hellenistic or even an early imperial Roman date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next find was again in Greek territorial waters, in Spring 1979: the bronze equestrian statue of a male was delivered by fishermen to the authorities, from the sea near the island of Ai Stratis (Agios Efstratios), in the northern Aegean.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was immediately identified as Augustus on the basis of the emperor’s portraits on coins. Statues like this were probably promoted by Roman state policy and distributed to the provinces to serve the aims of imperial propaganda. There is evidence of another bronze cuirassed equestrian statue from the same area, suggesting that the presumptive wreck may have carried a number of such sculptures. A small part of a bronze statue was delivered to the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities in 1981; it was never published and has lain forgotten ever since in the storerooms (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.3&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It exhibits the right thigh and the &lt;em&gt;pteryges&lt;/em&gt; (“feathers”) of the lower part of a cuirass of another life-size equestrian statue, possibly a companion or general of Augustus, although there is no clear evidence that the two bronzes originate from the same site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most monumental bronze statue to be raised from the sea, known as “Lady of Kalymnos,” was pulled up by a fishing boat in the sea east of the Greek island of Kalymnos in 1994, from a depth of about 120 meters (390 feet).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is a Hellenistic variation of the statue type known as the Large Herculaneum Woman. Variants of this type were used during the Hellenistic period to portray women from the middle and upper classes, queens, and even goddesses;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it exemplifies the ideal of the demure, respected lady of that era. On the basis of the idealized facial features and the similarity with works such as the Ackland Head,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:27&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the Lady of Kalymnos could, in all likelihood, be dated within the third century BC. The manner of representing the veil covering the head and hair very much recalls the portraits of Ptolemaic queens on coins. An identification of the Kalymnos Lady as Arsinoë III has recently been suggested by Olga Palagia, based on the similarity of the facial features to those of a bronze head in Mantua.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:28&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery of the Lady of Kalymnos to the Archaeological Service and the stupendous reward granted for it had a huge impact on the community of local fishermen and resulted in an unexpected chain reaction: for the next twenty years, parts of statues were delivered to the Department, some of them newly found and raised from the sea, others that had been stored for years in Kalymnian cellars. Dragging nets for the recovery of bronzes was for a while considered much more profitable than fishing. We can only imagine the damage inflicted to ancient shipwrecks in the deeps. Whatever entered the Hellenic Archaeological Service after 1994 was very fragmentary and of highly questionable origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fragment of a bronze dolphin was salvaged in 1997 in the waters off the north Dodecanese island of Leipsoi.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:29&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It has a broad, curved forehead and a wide raised snout that correspond to the widespread iconographic convention for Hellenistic dolphins. Iconographic parallels with dolphins in comparable representations allow this sculpture to be dated in the Hellenistic period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bronze head slightly larger than life-size was found in the sea northwest of Kalymnos in 1997.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:30&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:30&#34;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The head is a portrait of a mature bearded man wearing a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt;, the felt hat worn at the Macedonian court and used by the Diadochoi as a distinctive sign of their origin. The head is gently tilted with separated lips and eyes looking slightly upward—two features known from the iconography of Alexander the Great. But it also has some personalized characteristics such as a short, curly beard, mustache, short hair, and deep horizontal and vertical wrinkles in the middle of the forehead. These characteristics suggest that it is a portrait of a well-known man, a face that was to be immediately recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two identical bronze legs, right and left, were also found in the sea south of Kalymnos during 1997 and 1999, albeit in different locations, some nautical miles apart.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:31&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:31&#34;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Their knees are bent, and the lower legs slope gently downward, like legs of a rider who, like all ancient equestrians, did not use stirrups. The shoe is an almost perfect match with the &lt;em&gt;krepis&lt;/em&gt;, a sandal which, according to Pliny the Elder, was worn when traveling on foot or horseback. Feet wearing identical shoes are likewise found in Hellenistic bronzes, especially statues of riders, with all known examples dating to the third and second centuries BC. A fragmentary piece of a third leg was lifted from the sea northwest of Kalymnos,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:32&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:32&#34;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; suggesting the existence of at least two mounted bronze figures, but the evidence for combining the find-spots was highly controversial.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:33&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:33&#34;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006 a fragmentary body of an armored rider was raised from waters south of Kalymnos (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.4&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:34&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:34&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The rider wears a type of leather cuirass which corresponds to a &lt;em&gt;spolas&lt;/em&gt;, over a short-sleeved garment, and over it a &lt;em&gt;chlamys&lt;/em&gt;, which is fastened at the right shoulder and runs across the chest to fall freely down the back. The bottom part of the armor is decorated with a band of incised pairs of spiral motifs, while the lower edge exhibits a double line of &lt;em&gt;pteryges&lt;/em&gt;. The cuirass is tied at the waist with a cloth belt that crosses at the back and then fastens in an intricate knot at the center front, imitating the “Persian girdle” worn by Alexander the Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most complete piece of this group appeared in 2009: the full bust of an armored horseman, preserved from the neck down to the flaps of the cuirass (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.5&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:35&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:35&#34;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The head, both legs, and the horse are missing. The figure exhibits the same kind of cuirass as the rider found in 2006. The visible right shoulder strap is decorated with a relief of a winged thunderbolt. The left shoulder strap is hidden by the &lt;em&gt;chlamys&lt;/em&gt; which, fastened on the right shoulder, folds over the chest and falls back, covering the entire back. Clearly, the horseman held the horse’s reins with the left hand. The right hand is raised forward in a gesture of greeting. A strap hangs from the neck, down the left side of the cuirass, and is decorated with a plate incised with an archaistic female figure. The cuirass is tied at the waist with the exact same Persian-girdle manner as the find of 2006. Unlike its former companion, the whole work is fully decorated with minor details: a griffon under the armpit, a line of flying birds on the belt, and double spiral motifs at the lower edge of the thorax. The pair of legs raised in the 1990s have been securely associated with the figure. The attribution of the head with a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; to the one or the other rider torso, however, remains less certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two horsemen are of similar size, wear the same type of clothes and armor, were found in the same waters, and reasonably should be attributed to the same shipwreck.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:36&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:36&#34;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, the exact archaeological context is still lacking. The dating of the riders can be based only on stylistic and typological criteria: the style of the clothing, the double row of ﬂaps, and the knotted belt are all known already from a fourth-century BC rock relief depicting the general Alketas on the funerary monument at Termessos in Lycia.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:37&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:37&#34;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The elaborate belt (&lt;em&gt;cingulum&lt;/em&gt;) on the two armored riders appears in depictions of the Diadochoi and is adopted later by the Romans who used it to indicate that the wearer held an official post. Stylistic analysis of some details of the clothing, and the striking resemblance of the bent legs and leather shoes to an example found in a well in the Athenian Agora,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:38&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:38&#34;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; suggest a date from the third to the mid-second century BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now it has not been possible to identify the head with a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; with any certainty. It has, however, been suggested that it represents a famous Macedonian king. On grounds of iconographical resemblance with a much worn marble head from the island of Kos, Palagia suggests that it is Philip V, the penultimate ruler of the Antigonid dynasty.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:39&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:39&#34;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning the conditions of transport and loss of the statues retrieved from the sea near Kalymnos, we can only make assumptions. A &lt;em&gt;terminus ante quem&lt;/em&gt; for the date of the bronzes is provided by an intact stamped amphora, part of the same catch with the horseman recovered in 2006, partially covered with calcareous deposits containing a high percentage of copper oxides. This fact clearly demonstrates that the armored figure and the amphora were in the same underwater environment for a long time.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40&#34;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is a typical example of a Knidos-type amphora, which, on the basis of shape and the two stamps, can be dated approximately between 78 and the end of the first century BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the late finds originating from the Aegean there is also a life-sized bronze statue of a nude male, raised in 2004 from a depth of almost 450 meters (1,475 feet) in the area west of Kythnos in the Cyclades.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:41&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:41&#34;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The entire head, the right arm from the shoulder, the right leg from the knee down, and part of the back are missing. The nudity, the equipoise, and the musculature of the body suggest a robust athlete, perhaps a discus thrower. The dating of the bronze is still very uncertain and depends on its potential relationship with a shipwreck found in the same area, loaded with a mixed cargo that contained, among other items, Chian amphorae of the late fourth or early third century BC.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:42&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:42&#34;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest accession in this long series of bronzes found underwater is a head of a young male figure that was delivered to the Department by a spear-fisherman in late summer 2015 (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:43&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:43&#34;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was collected in shallow waters in front of the village of Agia Pelagia in the island of Kythira, south of Peloponnese; according to the existing evidence, it is not connected to any shipwreck remains. The rendering of the hair in shallow relief might indicate a late Hellenistic, if not early Roman, variation of an earlier prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any catalogue of bronzes retrieved from Greek or Turkish territorial waters inevitably remains incomplete: we lack information about the numerous bronzes that worked their way through illegal transactions directly into private collections or appeared out of nowhere on the international market. Ownership of art is &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; sanctioned by time. After aging a few years in private collections and then taking advantage of less strict legislation, they may well end up in collections of well-respected institutions. The repatriation in 2002 of a young male nude, now in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:44&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:44&#34;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is one of the very few that made its way back. The sculpture allegedly was found somewhere in the Ionian Sea, perhaps off Preveza, but as in most such cases, there is no definite information. No doubt, there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While complete or dismembered statues may at anytime rise from the deep to the full glare of publicity, investigators of shipwrecks on the coastal zone tend to conceal any trace of more valuable or uncommon cargo. As of Summer 2015, the number of ancient wrecks surveyed in Greek territorial waters exceeded two hundred. Yet the number of wreck-sites containing bronzes has remained stable for almost a century: Antikythera and Artemision, two of the very first wrecks ever investigated, were the only known examples until 2010. In that year a series of unexpected finds came to light during the opening of some trial trenches on a late Hellenistic shipwreck in the southern Euboean Gulf, off the island of Styra, at an accessible depth between 40 and 45 meters (131–147 feet).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:45&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:45&#34;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Several fragmentary pieces of bronze statues of natural size were unearthed by removing the upper sediments: a part of a nude calf, parts of folded drapery, and the selvage of a garment displaying a zone of inlaid reddish cooper (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.7&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:46&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:46&#34;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; From the same wreck, two intact bronze legs of a table or couch decorated with busts of sirens and acanthus leaves were also recovered (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.8&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:47&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:47&#34;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Luxury furniture is seldom found in ancient shipwrecks, with the only other known examples reported in the wrecks from Antikythera and Mahdia, both known for their cargo of bronzes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:48&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:48&#34;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bronzes, however, constituted only a small part of the total cargo of the Styra shipwreck. The main cargo was a consignment of north Peloponnesian (Sikyonian) amphorae and tableware (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3.9&lt;/strong&gt;). The nature of this complementary cargo of bronzes cannot be fully understood until the completion of the excavation. They could represent booty from the devastation of a town; the luxury belongings of an official who was travelling to or from his post; or even art objects ordered by a Roman patron. And considering the historic circumstances, fragmentary bronzes may well also have been collected as scrap and transported by sea on their way to the foundries that operated incessantly during that period to meet the demands of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Styra shipwreck clearly demonstrates that shipwrecks loaded with bronzes do not necessarily differ from any other carrier of the period. Scholars have made much of the heavy construction of the hulls from the Antikythera and the Mahdia shipwrecks.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:49&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:49&#34;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; No doubt, the Antikythera ship was a huge vessel with characteristics that only exceptionally large ships of the Roman era presented.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:50&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:50&#34;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, the rest of the consignment shipped together with statuary and luxury items does not differ significantly from any other cargo circulating in those years between the Aegean and the Adriatic Sea. The Antikythera wreck provided Rhodian, Koan, Ephesian, and Lamboglia II amphorae. Knidian amphorae were probably carried together with the bronzes recovered from the wreck off Kalymnos, as yet undiscovered. Amphorae are also reported from the Kythnos wreck, and mixed consignments can be traced even back to the early fourth century BC, with the Porticello shipwreck being the most characteristic example.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:51&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:51&#34;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Instead of indicating aberrant times, these mixed consignments seem to insinuate nothing out of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These facts clearly demonstrate that common boats, loaded with all kinds of commodities, were used to load the bronzes and make crossings. The correspondence of Cicero, in a letter written from Rome in March of 67 BC, seems to verify that. Cicero orders to his agent, Titus Pomponius Atticus, to find him Megarian statues, Pentelic herms, and any other statue suitable for a lecture hall and colonnade. Closing his letter he underscores that “if a ship of Lentulus is not available put them aboard any (ship) you think fit.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:52&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:52&#34;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It seems that any ship seaworthy and safe enough could have been used to transport works of art. If we push this argument to its extreme, any shipwreck, any amphora carrier dated between the years 150 BC and 50 AD could have carried bronzes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipwrecks transporting bronzes remain elusive no matter the time, means, and funds invested in tracing them. Several good reasons for this should be mentioned. Doubtless, the great depth to which these wrecks sank increases the operational cost of any underwater survey, and as such, it is not often expected to be prolonged to the final exhaustion of any possibility offered by a certain area. The dynamic underwater environment in several areas is now hiding and now unveiling traceable remains over and over again. Secondary, post-depositional removal of bronzes may also draw underwater investigation several miles away from the original spot of a wreck. False or deliberately misleading information also has its share in the failure of many missions of the past. While amateur divers have too often been flung into the breach between illusion and reality, professional fishermen remain very reluctant to provide accurate information, for fear of a possible generalized ban on the use of dragged nets in their traditional fishing fields. State policy must also claim a fair share of blame. While Hellenic law encourages and rewards the handing over of antiquities and information, bureaucratic procedures are often stalled by officious public servants with no interest in achieving a sensible balance between underwater archaeologists and local communities of fishermen: rewards can be delayed for years and this creates an additional ambience of mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining an archaeological context remains today the most crucial issue for the majority of bronzes retrieved underwater. Bronzes without context can still serve the history of art, but our understanding of the conditions of transit are relegated to the sphere of assumption. A subsequent need to relocate and investigate anew historic wrecks of the past is slowly being fulfilled. The painstaking documentation of the remains of the Antikythera shipwreck, now under excavation, will partly address that. The relocation of the remnants of the Artemision wreck is evoking a reconsideration of the date and circumstances of the ship’s transit. Experience has shown that only fully excavated shipwrecks and detailed study of all of the material on board can provide the kind of information that will allow scholars to link those wrecks to specific historical episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine bronze portrait head of a man wearing a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;figs. 4.1–3&lt;/strong&gt;) which was on display in the exhibitions &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt; in Florence, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., and &lt;em&gt;Pergamon and the Hellenistic Kingdoms of the Ancient World&lt;/em&gt; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is one of four over-life-size bronze statues of the Hellenistic period that were recovered from the sea near Kalymnos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another colossal bronze is a female portrait statue of very fine quality, dating from the late third century BC.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A third monumental bronze from the same area is the cuirassed torso of a horseman,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while a fourth is an even larger headless horseman,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which may or may not belong together with the &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; head. It is sometimes assumed that this bronze head belonged to an equestrian statue, but this is by no means established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All four statues could conceivably come from the same shipwreck, but we do not have a verified excavation context. The works were recovered by fishermen, who specified different findspots for each before turning them over to the Greek government. No shipwrecks have been located so far and the bronzes are not yet fully published, even though two of them were found in the previous century: the female statue was found in 1994, the head with a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; in 1997, the cuirassed torso in 2006, and the headless horseman in 2009.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is little doubt that all four statues are portraits. Their high quality and monumental size suggest that they are portraits of rulers or high officials of the Hellenistic period. In 2013 I published an article tentatively identifying the female portrait statue from the sea off Kalymnos with the Ptolemaic queen Arsinoë III, who reigned in the late third century BC, by comparison with the bronze head of Arsinoë in Mantua, which was also included in the exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I associated the statue with the island of Kos, where several portraits of the queen are attested and where a ruler cult of the Ptolemies was located. Kos is very close to Pserimos, where the bronze female allegedly came to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bronze head wearing a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; (see figs. 4.1–3) is slightly over life-size. It was created by an outstanding sculptor and is one of the finest bronzes to have come down to us from antiquity. He has a long, oval face, large ears, short hair, sideburns and a short beard. He wears a distinctive hat of mushroom shape, slightly pointed, ending in a sweatband around the scalp. It seems to imitate a leather cap, judging by its sharp edges, with a woolen sweatband. A similar hat is represented on the weapons frieze of the propylon of the sanctuary of Athena at Pergamon (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 4.4&lt;/strong&gt;), which dates from the reign of Eumenes II, probably from the 180s BC,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The same hat is worn by Seleukos II on his bronze coins minted at Susa in 228 BC.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Two Bactrian kings are also portrayed wearing this type of hat: Antimachos I on his coin portraits from around the first quarter of the second century BC (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 4.5&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Demetrios II on a clay seal from Seleukeia on the Tigris from the last quarter of the same century.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Their hat may be interpreted as a version of the &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt;, the Macedonian hat for elite men.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned by the historians of Alexander the Great as having been worn by Alexander and his companions. After his conquest of Persia, Alexander introduced a new royal headgear by combining his &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; with a Persian diadem, which was originally a cloth ribbon worn at the royal court of the Achaemenids.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was tied around one’s head, with its ends falling on the neck. Alexander tied the diadem around his &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt;, which became a &lt;em&gt;kausia diadematophoros&lt;/em&gt; and henceforth a royal prerogative&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Demetrios Poliorketes, king of Macedon from 306 to 283 BC, wore a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; with a double diadem.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This Macedonian royal headgear persisted until the time of (or was revived by) Cleopatra VII of Egypt. In 34 BC she presented her infant Ptolemy, son of Antony, at a public ceremony known as the Donations of Alexandria, wearing a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; with diadem.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his return from the expedition to India, Alexander presented his friends with purple &lt;em&gt;kausias&lt;/em&gt; as royal gifts.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This gesture was later imitated by Eumenes, who distributed purple &lt;em&gt;kausias&lt;/em&gt; to Alexander’s veterans.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Plutarch tells us that Alexander’s friend, Krateros, wore a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the hat is still attested at the court of Demetrios’s great-grandson, Philip V, who reigned from 221 to 179 BC.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier version of the &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt;, closer to Alexander the Great’s own time, is attested in the wall-paintings of Macedonian tombs from the late fourth and early third centuries BC. The hunting frieze on the façade of the so-called Tomb of Philip at Vergina shows two Macedonians in &lt;em&gt;kausias&lt;/em&gt; hunting with Alexander the Great.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; More &lt;em&gt;kausias&lt;/em&gt; are worn by royal pages and Macedonian bodyguards represented on the facade of the tomb of Agios Athanasios.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One of Alexander’s Companions on the Alexander mosaic, a second-century BC copy of an early Hellenistic painting of the battle of Issos, wears a similar &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We have no contemporary representations of Alexander wearing a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; with diadem, but he has been tentatively identified in a Roman copy of a Macedonian painting: a wall-painting from the Villa of Synistor at Boscoreale, dating from the mid-first century BC, shows a Macedonian sitting next to a Macedonian shield.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The figure wears a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; with a diadem tied around the head under the hat, its ends falling over the right ear. The identification with Alexander is based on the fact that the figure wears a Persian chiton.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We know that Alexander adopted a mixed Persian and Macedonian dress after the death of Dareios III in 330 BC;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; he is therefore the only Macedonian king who ever wore both a Persian garment and a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; with diadem, like the figure on the fresco from Boscoreale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander’s royal diadem was adopted by the Successors as a sign of royalty from 306 BC on. Plutarch, in his &lt;em&gt;Life of Demetrios&lt;/em&gt; (18)&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; provides a vivid description of the assumption of the diadem by Antigonos the One-Eyed and remarks that Ptolemy I and Lysimachos followed his example soon thereafter.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ptolemy I was the first to depict himself wearing a diadem on his coins.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:27&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The diadem continued to serve as royal insignia until the end of the Hellenistic period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of course quite obvious that the bronze head (see figs. 4.1–3) does not wear a royal diadem. Could he be a Macedonian king? Or is he one of the king’s friends, who were entitled to wear a &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; without a diadem? Equestrian bronze statues of high officials of the Macedonian kingdom voted by the Greek cities are attested as early as the late fourth century. For example, the Athenians honored Asandros with a statue in the Agora in 314/13 BC, while the Eritreans set up a statue of Timotheos in 309 BC.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:28&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head with &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; from near Kalymnos preserves no royal insignia. Could he still be a royal? The answer lies on Kos. A fragmentary portrait head in Parian marble (&lt;strong&gt;figs. 4.6–7&lt;/strong&gt;), showing almost certainly the same man and being of the same scale as the bronze head, comes from an unknown findspot on Kos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:29&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The marble head has the same oval-shaped face, large ears, drooping eyelids, sideburns, and short beard as the bronze head (see figs. 4.1–3). It differs in having luxuriant locks over the ears, but these may either indicate a slight change of hairstyle or may be due to the fact that the hair is not constrained by a hat. The marble head differs in another crucial detail: it wears a royal diadem, visible on the right profile;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:30&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:30&#34;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it therefore portrays a Hellenistic king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kos head was originally published by Gerhard Neumann, who suggested that it may represent the last Macedonian king, Perseus.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:31&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:31&#34;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, the shape of the face, the cheekbones, and the curly beard of Perseus’s coin portraits are quite different from the features of the man on Kos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:32&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:32&#34;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In her catalogue of the sculptures from Kos, Renate Kabus-Preisshofen pointed out the differences between the marble head and Perseus. She tentatively dated the Kos head to the last quarter of the third century, before the reign of Perseus, and suggested that it might be Philip V of Macedon, Perseus’s father.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:33&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:33&#34;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another possibility is of course Antigonos Doson, king of Macedon from 229 to 221, uncle and predecessor of Philip V. Doson received ruler cult on Kos in a shrine called Antigoneion, which is documented by a third-century inscription.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:34&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:34&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We do not know the location of this shrine or the nature of Doson’s benefaction to the Koans. It appears that this cult functioned until the second century BC. As Antigonos Doson did not portray himself on his coins, we do not know what he looked like. We do not even know whether he had a beard. The Successors of Alexander the Great were all clean-shaven following the example of the conqueror, and this fashion persisted in most Hellenistic dynasties. The situation in Macedon after Demetrios Poliorketes, who was clean-shaven,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:35&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:35&#34;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is uncertain, because we have no coin portraits of his successors until his great-grandson, Philip V, ascended the throne in 221. And Philip V sported a beard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coin portraits of Philip V (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 4.8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:36&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:36&#34;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; betray a lot of similarities to the bronze head (see fig. 4.3), especially the hairstyle and oval face. They also exhibit the same drooping eyelids as the marble portrait on Kos. Could the bronze and marble heads be portraits of Philip V? As we do not know what Antigonos Doson looked like, Philip V remains a distinct possibility. The presence of his marble portrait on Kos would not be so easy to explain, given that relations between Philip V and Kos were not friendly.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:37&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:37&#34;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But we know that his son Perseus had a royal estate on Kos, which he may well have inherited from his father.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:38&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:38&#34;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, the shrine of Antigonos Doson may have served as a repository of other royal Macedonian portraits. The Koans were more often than not staunch supporters of the Ptolemies,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:39&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:39&#34;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but they may have had to placate the aggressiveness of Philip V. The original location of our bronze head with &lt;em&gt;kausia&lt;/em&gt; is of course unknown, but Kos is not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the bronze head appears to represent a king of Macedonia of the late third century BC, very likely Philip V, and deserves pride of place among extant portraits of Hellenistic rulers. In addition, this is the only original over-life-size bronze portrait of a Macedonian king known to date, thus enriching our appreciation of the sculpture of Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ὑπὲρ Πτολεμαίου ἐμοῦ τοῦ Ἐπιφανεστάτου&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bronze head of Arsinoë III is one of the most important pieces in the Giuseppe Acerbi Collection of the Museo Civico di Palazzo Te in Mantua, a collection assembled when Acerbi was the Austrian consul general in Alexandria between 1826 and 1834 and later given to his hometown of Mantua (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.1&lt;/strong&gt;). Even compared with the exceptional quality of the overall collection, which is particularly strong in Late Period, Ptolemaic, and Roman material, this representation of Arsinoë III is singular. It is the only major bronze Acerbi acquired and it is a rare embodiment in that material of Hellenistic royal portraiture in the Greek tradition. The head (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.2&lt;/strong&gt;) connects strongly with other significant portraits displayed in the same room at the Palazzo Te. One is possibly a portrait of Psammetichus I, who took the throne of Egypt in the seventh century BC with the help of Greek mercenaries and who, by formally authorizing the Greek settlement at Naukratis south of Alexandria, opened the intercultural contact that would culminate in the Ptolemaic period.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another portrait of a Ptolemaic king is also nearby, rendered in the Egyptian style and identified as perhaps Ptolemy II Philadelphus,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who would have been the queen’s grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the head of Arsinoë III was published in the catalogue for the 2015–16 exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World&lt;/em&gt;, it was exhibited only at the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence and did not travel to either of the American venues. The catalogue entry, entitled “Portrait of Arsinoë III” and written by Elena Ghisellini, is illustrated with the same frontal image shown here as figure 5.2.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is important to note the title of the entry and the firmness of Ghisellini’s identification of this queen’s portrait, especially since other publications have sometimes opted for more generic names. For example, it is called simply “Testa femminile” in the Palazzo Te’s own publication &lt;em&gt;La Raccolta Egizia di Giuseppe Acerbi&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in Paul Stanwick’s &lt;em&gt;Portrait of the Ptolemies&lt;/em&gt; it is called “Bronze head attributed to Arsinoë III.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ghisellini has also written the most recent and complete monograph on the subject, &lt;em&gt;La regina Arsinoe: un ritratto bronzeo tolemaico da Mantova a Roma&lt;/em&gt; (2008) in conjunction with the exhibition &lt;em&gt;La Forza del Bello: L’arte greca conquista l’Italia&lt;/em&gt; held between Mantua and the Musei Capitolini in Rome. As she summarizes in the &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt; entry, citing Kyrieleis (1975), “The identification is confirmed by comparisons with the image of the queen on a series of gold octodrachms &amp;hellip; minted during the early years of the reign of her son Ptolemy V (204–180).”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My position, which fully accords with Ghisellini’s—that the bronze head from Mantua belongs to Arsinoë III—is substantiated, as will be shown, by the Archelaos Relief at the British Museum in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me initially upon seeing the bronze head, first from photographs and then in person, was the remarkably subtle combination of realism and idealism in the rendering of the features, an impression that is heightened when one compares the two profile views (&lt;strong&gt;figs. 5.3a–b&lt;/strong&gt;). They are appreciably different, a point to which I will return. Many scholars have considered two marble heads of a Ptolemaic king and queen in Boston as standards for studying the portrait sculpture of the fourth Ptolemaic royal couple, Ptolemy IV and Arsinoë III.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But the Boston case is not definitive, and neither is the numismatic evidence such as the series of gold octodrachms already cited. A unique realism has been noted in these coin portraits of Arsinoë III by R. R. R. Smith:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The queen’s coin portrait is unusual. It is close to Arsinoe II and Berenike II in its crisply articulated court style and greatly enlarged eyes, but here the queen has a sharp mortal individuality. Her prominent nose breaks the classical profile and she looks a little older than the ideal of young womanhood; and the whole seems to be of a woman who could age. The queen has no divine, only royal attributes: stephane, diadem and sceptre; and an air of reality is given by the prominent earrings and necklace. Her predecessors created new female royal ideals; she uses the same formal means but introduces a strong portrait element to express her more stern, rather Victorian-looking, royal style.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was her son Ptolemy V Epiphanes, of course, who introduced the series, not the queen herself. In speaking about the Mantua head, which he identifies as “most likely” the queen, Smith surprisingly describes it as “stiff and lifeless and the hair merely engraved on top of the head rather than modeled” and “not the best Hellenistic bronze work.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A view of the top of the head shows the incised patterning to which he refers (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.4&lt;/strong&gt;). Ghisellini, while recognizing the restrained realism, asserts that the whole adds up a little differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical principles dominate the structure of the head. The almost frontal view, the even contours, the harmonious proportions and the essentially symmetrical rendering of the features, and the simple elegant hairstyle are all classically inspired. However, this legacy does not diminish the portrait’s realism, but rather enhances it with a stately note. Indeed we can immediately perceive the divine nature of the queen who enjoyed immense popularity among all her subjects &amp;hellip; .&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghisellini, as already noted, utilized the frontal view for her principle assessment in this entry, but in the above quotation refers to it as the “almost frontal view.” By that she surely means the fine difference between the left and right sides of the face if divided on axis. As can be seen by close examination of figure 5.2, the head is shifted very slightly to its left. There is the slightest uplift visible in this left side of the face, from the mouth to the nose, the eye and eyebrow, through to the hairline. This matches the infinitesimal turn of the head also to the left. It must be remembered that if the statue had survived intact, parallax would have made this analysis impossible from the ground. It is a great luxury indeed to understand the finesse with which the axis is handled, which exact measurement would corroborate.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Comparing the profiles, however, is even more revealing of the dichotomy. The right profile (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3a&lt;/strong&gt;) embodies the realistic characteristics noted by both scholars: a certain heaviness in the treatment of the features and the ability to age, as Smith puts it very well. The rounded face gains little definition from the underlying bone structure, especially in the transition to the neck. The nose, a key element to Arsinoë’s portraiture recognized by both Smith and Ghisellini, maintains the slightly convex swelling along the bridge seen on the coins, as well as the sharp angularity at the tip. The line of the mouth is downward, but not in the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left profile (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 3b&lt;/strong&gt;), on the other hand, has a different vitality. There is an uplift, which one also observes from the front, and a focused energy that even the loss of the inlaid eye cannot impair. The mouth actually curves upward at the corner and the overall effect is one of tempered lightness. The hairstyle, considered her own as confirmed on the coinage, balances the face very well from any angle, but on this side the thrust of the twisted braids forming the bun at the back is stronger and extends forcibly, a perfect counterweight to the face. We appreciate how the braiding, far more plastic in its rendering of the strands of hair, forms a natural diadem for the queen making a stephane unnecessary (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.4&lt;/strong&gt;). Yet the deep groove between the side braids and the carefully combed crown is capable of receiving one, as noted by Smith. It is the more enlivened left profile, then, that has the sense of rejuvenation and hence divinity about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one Hellenistic relief that I claim relates directly to the Mantua head because it sheds further light on these mixed elements of realism and divinity in Arsinoë’s portraiture: the Archelaos Relief, signed by Archelaos of Priene (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.5&lt;/strong&gt;). Found at Bovillae, some 19 kilometers (12 miles) outside of Rome, and now in the British Museum, the relief presents the immortalization of Homer in a series of four registers.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The event itself is depicted on the bottom register; then it is celebrated by Apollo and a number of the Muses on the second register, by Mnemosyne and other figures on the third register, and finally by Zeus at the apex. These deities indicate the divine inspiration enjoyed by Homer from the inception of his works and facilitate his triumphant “homecoming.” J. J. Pollitt states that the facial similarity between Homer and Zeus not only brings the two together but is responsible for the modern title “Apotheosis of Homer” sometimes given to the relief.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is in addition a standing figure on the far right of the second register, positioned in contrapposto upon a statue base and holding a scroll with a lightly incised tripod behind him. While this could very likely be a victorious poet honored by the stele or the dedicant proper,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it could conceivably be Homer himself as a younger genius, especially if the relief were implying an actual apotheosis, i.e. the raising of the individual to the higher status.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But of greatest interest to us here is the pair of figures farthest to the left on the bottom register, stepping toward the seated Homer, framing the scene on that side, and acting as sole agents in his crowning (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.6a&lt;/strong&gt;). Recognizable from coin portraits, the couple is unquestionably Ptolemy IV and Arsinoë III—Richard Neer calls the portraits “thinly disguised”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—although other rulers have been proposed in the past.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; No matter what date is given to the relief or its actual place of manufacture,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the end it comes back to this couple and hence the traditions of the Alexandrine literati. Ptolemy IV, known throughout his reign for his religious piety, erected a Homereion as part of his temple-building campaign in Alexandria honoring many of the Egyptian gods.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; An important anonymous papyrus preserves an epigram in which Ptolemy IV is called “blessed” for this act.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Aelian (&lt;em&gt;Varia historia&lt;/em&gt; 13.22) also attests to the foundation of the Homereion. While the location of the shrine is not known, it is worth citing the passage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Πτολεμαῖος ὁ Φιλοπάτωρ κατασκευάσας Ὁμήρῳ νέων, αὑτὸν μὲν καλὸν καλῶς ἐκάθισε, κύκλῳ δὲ τὰς πόλεις περιέστησε τοῦ ἀγάλματος, ὅσαι ἀντιποιοῦνται τοῦ Ὁμήρου. Γαλάτων δέ ὁ ζωγράφος ἔγαψε τὸν μὲν Ὅμηρον ἀυτὸν ἐμοῦντα, τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ποιητὰς τὰ ἑμημεσμένα ἀρυτομένους.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This description brings to mind the circle of poets, part of the dromos installation at the Sarapieion of Saqqara, the statuary of which may well be dated to the reign of Ptolemy IV.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Homer was among the subjects of that elite circle of statues, if not the focal point. This has led me to a tentative theory that what is depicted on the Archelaos Relief may also be related to the larger installation, firmly connecting Alexandria to Memphis.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Archelaos Relief depicts at least two distinct environments. The first is the theatrical ambience on the bottom register with its backdrop of columns joined by a draped curtain attached just below the abacus of each column. The result is a shallow, contained space dominated by Homer and the royal couple to the left. In front of Homer, just off-center, is a circular altar, with a magnificent, Apis-like horned bull looming over it. Two small figures, kneeling and flanking Homer’s throne, are personifications of the bard’s epic creations, as the inscriptions below tell the viewer. Facing Homer on the other side of the altar are the genres of literature and intellect that acknowledge his inspiration and will ultimately carry it forward. The &lt;em&gt;rhythmos&lt;/em&gt; of the scene is interesting. There is a processional quality to the repetitious, fixed contrapposto position of many of the figures on the right, with everyone gesturing toward Homer. The votive effect has been noted by several scholars.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The second environment of the relief is the mountain-like ascent of the upper registers combining some architectonic elements, such as the cavelike archway or grotto sheltering Apollo and the curving, graded stairway connecting the third register to the top. Neer has associated these details with a shrine to the Muses overlooking the Great Library at Alexandria,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but it is very possible that we could be looking at some part or parts of the Homereion itself. The figure on the statue base is positioned directly below the staircase between the third and fourth registers. Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses, stands in contrapposto on an outcropping of rock to the left of the stairway, looking upward toward a reclining Zeus. Her imposing figure breaks down the division between the third and fourth registers. Their offspring, the Muses, are the major occupants of the registers below. Zahra Newby traces what would have been the orchestration of the eye contact between these figures, many now missing their actual heads.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Space and the transmission of knowledge are definitely handled differently in the upper three registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While undoubtedly advancing side-by-side toward Homer in three-dimensional space, the conventions of the two-dimensional relief put Ptolemy IV’s head just ahead of his wife’s on the left end of the bottom register. The hands of Arsinoë III holding the stephane over Homer’s head, however, extend beyond the hands of her husband, each holding a scroll. But the subtleties go beyond this. The three heads—those of Ptolemy, Homer, and Arsinoë—are cut at significantly different levels. They range from the very precise, coin-like quality of Ptolemy IV’s profile in low relief, to the higher treatment of the seated Homer’s almost three-quarter turn, to the fully achieved three-quarter high relief of Arsinoë III (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.6b&lt;/strong&gt;). It is even possible to sense the existence of the far side of her face, recalling the profile views of Arsinoë III in Mantua and that peculiar blending of the realistic and divinized aspects of the queen in a single artwork. It may be asking too much, given the wear on her image (breakage of the nose to start with) to talk about the far side of Arsinoë’s portrait on the Archelaos Relief; but my assessment of her right profile is that it is idealized. There is, once again, that rejuvenated quality in the face; she looks young especially alongside her husband. Her mouth is visibly upturned. This is not the “Victorian” realism of the octodrachm coin portrait. One can speak even more definitively of her hairstyle: it is exactly that of the Mantua head but with an important difference. The twisted bun at the back is draped, the long material visibly extending over her right shoulder, signifying the religious import of her action. But unlike the full &lt;em&gt;capite velato&lt;/em&gt; regularly seen in the coinage of her predecessors Arsinoë II and Berenike II, the coin portrait of this queen, as we have learned, is more worldly. If she were to have worn the full &lt;em&gt;capite velato&lt;/em&gt; on the Archelaos Relief, what a shift it would have made in the whole iconographical message. Instead, Arsinoë III takes absolute command of the deification of Homer via her choice of headgear, namely the polos crown reserved for goddesses, among them Aphrodite or Tyche, dominating the partial &lt;em&gt;capite velato&lt;/em&gt;. Ptolemy may have been given wings (rendered in the lightest relief) but she is the deified and deifying force propelling the action of the relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of inscriptions situated along the narrow frame below the relief zone clinches the meaning of the bottom register where the couple is so strategically located (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.7&lt;/strong&gt;). These inscriptions are labels or tags. Their force is didactic but in the fullest sense of the word because they teach on multiple levels. They congregate in two groupings, one to the left and the other to the right, positioned beneath the subject matter to which they relate. They have enabled Andrew Stewart to call this one of the most important allegories in all of Hellenistic art.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:27&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Significantly, a &lt;em&gt;vacat&lt;/em&gt; (empty space) is left directly under the cylindrical altar, heightening its heraldic position, but there is a graphic mark in the middle of its squared base. The labels are selective in their disclosure as they identify only Homer and his works, the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, by true name; the rest of them are personifications from the major genres of literature, together with four of the Virtues (on the far right paying homage). Most importantly, Ptolemy IV and Arsinoë III could, like Homer, have been labeled by name, but they are not. The very first inscription on the left is &lt;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps;&#34;&gt;Oikoumene&lt;/span&gt;, and it belongs to Arsinoë III. It is closely followed by &lt;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps;&#34;&gt;Khronos&lt;/span&gt;, the identifier for Ptolemy IV; together they designate the embodied power that deifies Homer. “Oikoumene” is extremely rich in its possible interpretations here. Literally, the word translates as the “inhabited region”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:28&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but at various periods of usage it could mean the Greek world as opposed to the barbarian, the generally inhabited versus the uninhabited, and finally the whole world or (in the plural) earthly worlds. The message must be that Homer would be comprehensible to such worlds, further implying the pervasiveness of the Greek language, epitomized by the very use of Greek inscription on the relief. The remarkable thing about associating Oikoumene with Arsinoë III is the fact she is herself crowned with the polos. Before its definition as the headdress of a goddess, &lt;em&gt;polos&lt;/em&gt; meant a pivot, an axis on which things turn, including that of the celestial sphere.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:29&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The turning of such a sphere implies dissemination through space, and the fact that Arsinoë crowns Homer with a circular stephane held by her outstretched hands is surely in keeping with the imagery being invoked by her label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Khronos&lt;/em&gt; (time) is necessarily more two-dimensional in depiction compared to Oikoumene, but the profile of Ptolemy IV loses nothing and compares beautifully with the coins.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:30&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:30&#34;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Time in the sense of this relief is not Egyptian time, whether &lt;em&gt;neheh&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;djet&lt;/em&gt;, so eloquently explicated by Jan Assmann.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:31&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:31&#34;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The linearity of time is the product of the Greeks, Assmann asserts, and was ultimately embraced by the West. It is well that Ptolemy IV embodies it. Furthermore, as previously stated, he is carrying two scrolls, one in each hand. The right proper hand is raised, the left is lowered, actually mimicking the respective gestures of the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; figures alongside Homer. Ptolemy’s scrolls are surely alluding to the epics themselves, preserved on papyrus as they would be found in the Great Library, and consequently a concrete metatext. The single scroll held by Homer with his right hand—his left holds a staff—reinforces the power of the written word despite the genesis of the epics through the oral tradition. There is thus a practicality that comes with Assmann’s linearity: documentation provided by the relief itself, which is expected to last through time, just as the Homeric epics themselves did. Homer’s footstool appears to bear a relief of two mice facing off; it has been judged by some to be symbolic of the &lt;em&gt;Batrachomyomachia&lt;/em&gt; attributed to the poet in antiquity, but Stewart describes the combative mice as “reminders of what would happen to his books in a lesser institution.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:32&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:32&#34;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Most importantly, I would argue, the mice are embellishments deliberately placed under the feet of Homer. While there could be multiple meanings, there is a sure sense that he is subjugating any threat to his greatest works, parody or otherwise, entirely in the tradition of any Pharaonic footstool richly ornamented with the foes of Egypt.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:33&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:33&#34;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build of this relief as it climbs from footstool through to the uppermost register implies something enormous in vision, but it is still a very active, not a crystallized immortality; things work in all directions, horizontally and vertically, including not only the association of Homer with Zeus but also the location of the artist’s signature. It is essential to consider why the artist’s signature, the only other inscription besides those connected to the bottom register, is boldly placed in a wide, striplike &lt;em&gt;tabula ansata&lt;/em&gt; just below Zeus (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 5.8&lt;/strong&gt;). Furthermore, Euterpe, identifiable by her double flute, is seated underneath the signature and points to the name of the artist with her instrument. Archelaos signs on the central vertical axis of the relief; only Zeus is higher. Newby does not examine the palaeography of the signature, the disposition of the name, or the gesture of the Muse beyond the generalized observation that “The one to the left looks upwards and points towards Zeus and Archelaos’ signature with a double flute,” and this is surely a major omission.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:34&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:34&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The signature is very well cut with extended serifs, its letterforms enlarged and regular in size as compared to the variable letter height of the bottom register. Brunilde Ridgway makes the interesting comment that the tabula-like treatment of this signature links it more likely to an Italian manufacture. I would add that the ordering of the patronymic and demotic could be significant in that respect as well. This palaeography requires more study than it has thus far received.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:35&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:35&#34;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The signature of Archelaos of Priene, like the royal couple and the standing figure on the second-register statue base, is on the conduit between Homer and Zeus. It all starts in the bottom left-hand corner with Arsinoë III labeled “Oikoumene”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Archelaos Relief, but also prompting analysis of the real and divine nature of Arsinoë III, mention must be made of one of the most critical representations of this queen from the standpoint of Egyptian history, namely her image on the Raphia Decree. One of three surviving fragmentary copies of the decree, which was enacted in 217 BC to commemorate the victory of Ptolemy IV over the Seleucids that year, is displayed in the Ptolemaic galleries of the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:36&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:36&#34;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This Egyptian-style stele carries the official decree in dark granite; it is trilingual like the Rosetta Stone, with an incised composition in the lunette portion where, because of the break lines, only images of the king and queen are preserved. In a simple line relief, Ptolemy IV, in Egyptian military dress and wearing the double crown, rides on horseback against the enemy, presumed to be Antiochus III if the other portion of the relief had survived.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:37&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:37&#34;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Goddesslike, Arsinoë III stands immediately behind him, substantiating the ancient description of the battle and her physical presence there.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:38&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:38&#34;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the Raphia representation, as opposed to the Archelaos Relief, the couple’s roles have reversed. Here Ptolemy IV is the active member, charging his horse toward the Seleucids, with Arsinoë standing firm. On the more fully preserved lunette of the copy known as the Pithom Stele II, also in the Egyptian Museum,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:39&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:39&#34;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ptolemy IV is likewise shown on horseback, now in Macedonian military dress; he dominates over the kneeling enemy with the Egyptian gods in attendance while Arsinoë retains the full Egyptian style.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40&#34;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Günther Hölbl remarks on the innovation the Raphia Decree brings to official Egyptian art by showing the pharaoh on horseback.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:41&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:41&#34;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But there can be no doubt that this image of the king, authorized by the priests in the decree itself,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:42&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:42&#34;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; resonates with the Greek tradition and the power of Alexander on his famed horse Bucephalos. Arsinoë, however, is Egyptianized in stance and costume. Her double-plumed solar crown is a type worn by queens as well as goddesses, one of the most renowned examples being the depiction of Ankhesnamun attending the seated Tutankhamun on the back of the golden throne from his tomb. The horns of Hathor enclosing the double plumes of Ankhesnamun’s crown are not apparent on either of the copies of the Raphia Decree, but Arsinoë’s divine identity is assured. The text of the Raphia Decree not only honors the divinized Theoi Philopatores (Ptolemy) but commissions statues of the queen in standing position beside her husband for all major temples.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:43&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:43&#34;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, via the lunette’s most economical of images, the whole of the famous battle—which Arsinoë is also credited with saving—is reduced down to the principal figures. They are depicted acting as pure divinities on the battlefield and in heraldic composition, securing simultaneously their fame and the continuity of their dynasty within Pharaonic Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of Arsinoë III in Mantua, however, is the key to understanding her subtle, two-sided portraiture and exploring the phenomenon of the Greek interaction with Egypt under the Ptolemies. The specific dynamic between this representation and that of the queen on the Archelaos Relief calls for a reinterpretation of her portrait type. The survival of these works is fortuitous: the bronze for its material in the heroic sense and the marble relief for the divine personification of the queen as Oikoumene. Both masterfully mix realism and divinity. The head in Mantua may be argued to show the queen at her most beautiful: the perfect balance between realistic and idealized parts, whether analyzed from the front, sides, or any other viewpoint. The relief, on the other hand, shows her leading the action not only on the bottom register but in the narrative as a whole: the overwhelming feminine presence, the sheer number of Muses and female personifications needs to be taken into account. It is she who bestows the crown and hence births the deification of the epic embodiment of Greek cultural memory. The role of Hellenistic Alexandria, her home base, is acknowledged very soundly as the place of genesis, if not origin, for the ideology embodied in both the bronze head and the marble relief. It is the necessary catalyst for motivating two such sophisticated responses within the type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:12&#34;&gt;Zeus’s register, while pedimental in shape and imitating the peak of a mountain, is still its own entity. It is accessed by the transitional space on the right, connecting to the next register below. Newby (2007, 158) counts only three main registers. She also discusses the “false closure” on the far right side of the second register where the statue on its base is located, and the “mezzanine platform” just below Zeus occupied by Mnemosyne (162). The British Museum description for fig. 5.7 refers to “four tiers.”

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:17&#34;&gt;Stewart (1990, 1: 217) accepts the identification of the Ptolemaic couple: “&amp;hellip; recognizable as Ptolemy and Arsinoe from both the context and the king’s rather bloated features.” Ridgway (2000, 207) gives the “range of proposed attributions”: Ptolemies, Seleucids, and Attalids. She concludes, “This very range of suggestions should suffice to prove our inability to make a positive identification of two diminutive heads that, in my opinion, correspond to common types rather than to specific individuals.” See also Richter 1965, 1: 54 andfig. 120; and 3: fig. 1831, who advocates Ptolemy IV and Arsinoë III and shows in fig. 3: 1831 a close-up of the heads on the relief, almost coin-like in precision.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:18&#34;&gt;Pollitt (1986, 16) indicates the role that letterforms have played in the dating: “The date of the Archelaos relief has been sought for by most scholars in the form of the letters in its inscriptions. For many years it was generally held that the lettering confirmed a date of ca. 125 B.C. Recent studies suggest, however, that a somewhat earlier date is not only possible but perhaps even probable.” Stewart (1990, 1: 217) brings in the sculptural types as well: “Dates range from Ptolemy’s own lifetime to the later second century, depending on where one dates the Muses it reproduces and the letter forms of the inscriptions.” Ridgway (2001, 265–66) favors a first century–BC date and offers sound evidence for the Late Republican interest in Homer in the area in which the Archelaos Relief was found. She reiterates this in Ridgeway 2000, 207–208 and Ridgway 2002, 96, n. 8.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:19&#34;&gt;McKenzie 2007, 64. Fraser [1972] 2001, 1: 611. Fraser discusses the association of the poems in P.Cair. 65445 dealing with the Homereion and the Fountain of Arsinoë with Ptolemy IV Philopator and Arsinoë III. While McKenzie references the Homereion, she does not bring in the Archelaos Relief or its architectural implications.

In a disappointing assessment, Fraser seemingly disassociates the Archelaos Relief not only with Ptolemy IV and Arsinoë, but with Alexandria itself. The reasons given are not clear. Mention is made of a “later date.”

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:25&#34;&gt;Neer 2012, 380. Stewart (1990, 1: 217), describing the upper registers of the relief, writes, “And soaring above this firm foundation [the first register] are the dizzy heights of the Mouseion, where the poet may keep company with the Muses and Apollo, progeny of Zeus himself.” McKenzie (2007, 51) gives details of the Museum and Library complex based on Herodotus, but states that the location and exact plans are not known (74, 76).

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:27&#34;&gt;Stewart 1990, 1: 217. Newby (2007, 158, 165) takes exception with the word “didactic” and to some degree with the allegorical identification, arguing that allegory lies not in the personifications of Homer’s worshippers per se but in the literal differentiation between the bottom section of the object (where the inscriptions are) and the votive relief above. Ridgway (2000, 207) considers the didactic nature of the relief its raison d’être, as opposed to connections with a votive offering, arguing for its pragmatic, educational use in Italy. My response is that the bona fide allegory begins with Oikoumene and Khronos on the far left because they really are Arsinoë and Ptolemy. Homer is ultimately going to be dwelling in more than one “inhabited world” and “time zone,” and that is worth teaching.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:33&#34;&gt;While Ridgway (2002, 3: 117–118) does not discuss the footstool, she sees Egyptianizing influence in the presence of the two small literary “offspring” of Homer, like the children or wives placed alongside the principal male figure in Egyptian reliefs “as is typical of Egyptian family groups since the Old Kingdom.” She further suggests that the Italian taste for Egyptianization “may serve to confirm the first-century date and Italian destination.”

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:35&#34;&gt;The palaeography is valuable in this inscription, both aesthetically and for chronological considerations as already noted. Newby (2007, 172) mentions the “epigraphical grounds” leading some to a date of ca. 125 BC, but does not explain what those epigraphical grounds are. Concerning the inscriptions of the Hellenistic period in general, Ridgway, referencing Pinkwart (1965), states a commonly held belief that “Epigraphy is of little help, since no clear development can be discerned over wide geographical areas. Relative chronology can be attempted only within each site, if a fairly substantial corpus of inscriptions is preserved for internal comparison.”

      <title>The Apollo from Salerno</title>

&lt;p&gt;The bronze head of Apollo found in the waters of the Gulf of Salerno in 1930 still offers an opportunity to discuss the date, casting and production, place of manufacture, and function of the work of art in antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laboratory analysis shows that the bronze has percentages of copper (81%), lead (11%), and tin (5.5%) that can be associated with alloys found in the Roman Imperial period.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The presence of copper was higher in the oldest bronzes (84–92%). Further evidence confirms that during the Roman phase, for large-scale bronze statuary, the lead content could reach up to 20 percent with tin up to 10 percent.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the artistic history of the Italian peninsula, the period ranging from Hannibal’s invasion to the battle of Actium is undoubtedly the hardest to analyze. After the Hannibalic wars, the Italian territory acquired greater political autonomy and the Roman Republic started to become a single cultural unit. The classic artistic themes of the Hellenistic courts were rendered through new interpretations. Hellenic culture in Italy got its foothold in Taranto, from whence it spread throughout the peninsula. Its counterpart is in Sicily, where mostly Alexandrian themes were diffused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literary sources confirm that, mainly starting from the second century BC, a great many works of art were transferred to Rome as war booty from the Mediterranean East. Many notable Italian and noble Roman families sought to make this culture their own, recalling the luxurious environment of the northern Grecian courts, of Egypt, and of the Hellenistic East. The Roman &lt;em&gt;nobilitas&lt;/em&gt; adhered to these canons starting from the first century BC. The discoveries of Hellenistic bronze armor in the region of Latium and the bronzes and ivories from Palestrina testify that, at least for the dominant classes in Rome, there existed a formal culture in which skilled workers were able to create sophisticated works of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of manufacture, the bronze head under discussion was made by the indirect lost-wax technique; the top of the head was joined above the fillet; and some individual curls were also cast separately and joined. The head once belonged to a larger-than-life-size sculpture, probably wearing a cloak and intended to be seen mainly from the front for a religious purpose or as a symbolic expression of elite power. The size and softness of the forms define a composition of elements expertly aggregated, as often happens with bronze and terracotta. The rhythmic complexity, resulting from the movement and inclination of the head, seems to be subjected to a single principle: a rendering style of curves and contours inherited from the Hellenistic Baroque (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 6.1&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features that might suggest Italian production—combining tradition and innovation—have yet to be evaluated and analyzed in depth. Influences from both the cosmopolitan Hellenistic world and the Vesuvian region as well as, even more broadly, from Magna Graecia, may also be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Hellenistic matrix in the Apolline iconography is discoverable also in the Roman coins of Campania, which were widely diffused throughout the territory. Starting from the third century BC, the staters from Sessa Aurunca, an inland Campanian town, reveals a new image of Apollo. On this coin, his mane of hair reaches the shoulders; his head is crowned with a laurel wreath; and the rings of the neck are very pronounced, as in the Apollo from Salerno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campania represented an environment that connected the tendencies and symbolism of the Hellenistic art with the rest of southern and Apennine Italy. More precisely, the maritime towns of Campania (Cuma, Puteoli, Neapolis, Paestum), in contrast with the inland towns, maintained a Hellenistic manufacturing tradition with a characteristic manner of portraying the deities and famous characters of Hellenism. These characteristic motifs are developed to a high degree of stylistic maturity and come to life in the figurative art of the Late Republic and the early Imperial age, the phase to which the Apollo head likely belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wider frame of the particular political and commercial interests along the Campanian coast, Rome had in 197 BC approved the &lt;em&gt;Lex Atinia de coloniis deducendis&lt;/em&gt; for the foundation of five maritime colonies in Campania economic; the colony of Salernum was founded shortly thereafter, in 194 BC. Thanks to the creation of the Via Popilia in 132 BC, it soon became an important commercial confluence, reaching a high level of prosperity and wealth in Augustan age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neapolis (modern Naples), a few kilometres away from Salernum, was an active center of figurative art from the earliest imperial times. There were a great many bronze artisans who produced work for export as well as for the surrounding areas. According to some literary sources, there was a sculptor named Pasiteles, born in Neapolis, who worked in the first century AD. A note in Pliny’s &lt;em&gt;Natural History&lt;/em&gt;, taken from Varro (&lt;em&gt;Naturalis historia&lt;/em&gt; 35.39–40) reports that Pasiteles was born on the “Grecian Italian coast”—that is, in Magna Graecia. The term was earlier used generically to indicate most of southern Italy, but during Varro’s age it referred to the coastal towns from Cuma to Taranto. The literary tradition suggests that Pasiteles’ activity was mostly carried on between Rome and Neapolis, and that he was able to sculpt in every medium. We cannot exclude the possibility that our Apollo is the product of one of the flourishing Neapolitan workshops in which artists like Pasiteles worked, or even is a work of his followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cult of Apollo has very ancient manifestations, especially along the Ionic and Campanian coasts, which were rejuvenated during the time of Sulla&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and even more strongly during the &lt;em&gt;Pax Augustea&lt;/em&gt;. Apollo, a bright deity, was a fitting emblem for the political program of renewal and purification pursued by Octavian-Apollo. The building of the temple of Palatine Apollo in Rome and the renewal of the surrounding area were among the key points in the thoughtful and global project of cultural propaganda planned by Octavian during the years of his rise to power and its reinforcement after the victory at Actium. Apollo represented the official protector of Octavian/Augustus or, according to a well-planned line of propaganda, his divine parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also assume that the Apolline allegory, shown through the detailed style and the formal magnificence of our Apollo, is a symbolic expression of the power of a restricted elite (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 6.2&lt;/strong&gt;). Outside the confines of Rome, the forms of communication of the central power and its modalities of reception by the local elites found their expression in a complex game of interactions. The ties between Rome and Campania were strengthened and most fully expressed during the Augustan age through the creation of &lt;em&gt;regio I&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the Romans, Campania is the ideal place to heal the disagreement between &lt;em&gt;luxuria&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mos maiorum&lt;/em&gt; through the experience of &lt;em&gt;otium&lt;/em&gt;. The collecting of and taste for art, the luxurious furniture and decorations, the practice of the thermal baths, and the theater experienced in the villas of Campania became paradigmatic of the golden age as promoted by Augustan propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly probably, the bronze Apollo is proof of how the most influential Campanian families, whose lives were spent on the coast, adhered to and identified themselves with this cultural program and with the mythology of the mastery of the &lt;em&gt;princeps&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have to evaluate and analyze the aspects of the head that indicate the characteristic features of this Italian production. The artisans’ ability to meld tradition and innovation reflects both the cosmopolitan heritage of the Hellenic universe and a parallel elaboration of Vesuvian and, on a larger scale, Magna Grecian influences, played out at that particular moment of transition from the tumultuous Republican period to the florid Augustan peace of whom Apollo is the tutelary deity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on a collaboration to conserve the bronze Apollo from Pompeii,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the J. Paul Getty Museum partnered with the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli between 2012 and 2013 to return the larger-than-life-size portrait of Emperor Tiberius (42 BC‒AD 37) from Herculaneum for display (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.1&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The statue, which measured 2.4 meters (8 feet) in height, had been off view for some twenty years, owing to weaknesses in the legs and base. The opportunity to resolve these issues, and the generous support of our colleagues in Naples, allowed us to undertake a full study of the statue’s historical restorations and ancient manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovery-and-ancient-context&#34;&gt;Discovery and Ancient Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portrait was discovered on August 30, 1741; three days later, an inscription believed to belong to it was found nearby.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This would date the statue to AD 36 or 37, suggesting that the council dedicated it to Tiberius in the last year of his life or even posthumously. The portrait would then have stood for 42 years until the eruption of Vesuvius in 79.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early publications indicate that the statue had been found in the Theater at Herculaneum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, in recent decades, study of archival sources indicates that excavations were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; underway there when the Tiberius was discovered. Rather, activity was focused on the area of the Porticus (the so-called Basilica), and excavation reports from this time refer to the discovery of two bronze female figures and one male, the latter most likely Tiberius. Tina Najbjerg has fully explored the arguments in favor of the statue’s location in the Porticus,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and, proposing that this building was set up in the Claudian period, discusses its adornment with a series of imperial portraits that were added to and moved around during the three decades prior to the eruption of Vesuvius.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The statue of Tiberius would thus have been part of a Julio-Claudian family group that was displayed in the niches along the east and west sides of the building. Nevertheless, a chronological puzzle remains, for, as noted, the inscription dates the portrait to 36 or 37, a decade earlier than the building of the Porticus. Najbjerg proposes that the statue could have served initially as a cult image in the nearby Collegio degli’Augustali; when Tiberius died, it would have been moved and set up in the Porticus.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;eighteenth-century-restoration&#34;&gt;Eighteenth-Century Restoration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest illustration of the portrait, dating to 1771,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows it fully intact (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.2.&lt;/strong&gt;). However, discoveries from the Vesuvian sites often underwent extensive intervention before they were put on display, and such work was rarely mentioned in contemporary publications. In the case of the Tiberius, we have archival evidence for its restoration. Camillo Paderni reported on June 14, 1760—almost nineteen years after the portrait had been discovered—that its reassembly had been completed, and all that remained was to provide a patina.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A substantial body of research has accumulated regarding the practices of the Royal Foundry at Portici, most substantially by Götz Lahusen and Edilberto Formigli.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Their observations regarding the restoration of the Tiberius are, however, relatively brief, since their access to the statue was limited. Nonetheless our findings match with what has been observed for the other large Herculaneum bronzes (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.3&lt;/strong&gt;).Thus, the Tiberius was aggressively cleaned with rasps, files, and possibly acids. The left hand, which had been separated on discovery, was reattached, and other missing sections were repaired by being cast &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; and pinned for added security. The right arm is also a restoration, but does not appear to belong to the ancient statue. The portrait was then given a patina, which was achieved by the application of oxidizing solutions with heat. Finally, small fills were executed using a dark putty containing corrosion products that had been removed from the statue’s surface during cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ancient-manufacture&#34;&gt;Ancient Manufacture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aggressive and invasive methods used by the Royal Foundry to clean and restore the Tiberius posed substantial challenges to our attempts to understand its ancient manufacture. Nonetheless, through a combination of close visual observation, technical analysis, and some sampling, we have been able to glean evidence for the ways in which the portrait was conceived and assembled. At the outset, we expected to find that the statue was composed of a number of parts. This was standard practice and has been well-documented for many other large ancient bronzes. Unanticipated, however, was the quantity of individual pieces. In total, we identified 62 separate bronze parts (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7a‒b&lt;/strong&gt;). In order to fully appreciate the reasons for this, we will present a step-by-step reconstruction of the statue’s manufacture, highlighting its division into sections and subsections, and the substantial forethought that went into the early stages of production in order to facilitate the later phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creation-and-assembly-of-the-wax-model&#34;&gt;Creation and Assembly of the Wax Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to produce the statue, the sculptors would have fashioned a wax working-model. This was likely achieved with pre-existing molds for a number of the anatomical sections, such as the hands, arms, and the portrait head, which is entirely open in the back where it is covered by the drapery. Residual burial encrustations and the eighteenth-century restorations make it difficult to ascertain how these various wax sections would have been formed. There are no seams to indicate that wax slabs had been applied to the interior of the molds, and given the bronze’s regular thickness and the even modeling between its inner and outer surfaces, we surmise instead that the molds would have been brushed with molten wax. In the case of the head, liquefied wax may have been slurried within the mold, for there is a thickening of the metal at the nose and chin, where pools are likely to have formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the drapery, the consistent thickness of the metal suggests that molds were used in the production of the wax working-model. However, the complex patterns of the folds could not have been pulled directly from molds. Indeed, their deep undercuts would be impossible to obtain without substantially distorting or even destroying the solidified wax. We propose, therefore, that areas of drapery started out being relatively schematic in the wax-working stage, and that they were then refined to create the arrangement of individual folds. Some of this work might have been done &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;, but in other cases wax sections could have been excised, worked up to create high-relief folds, and then reincorporated back into the working model. Some sections could have been subdivided further into pieces, in order to produce the assemblage of naturalistic drapery fold-by-fold. To get a sense of the degree of elaboration that this process allowed, compare the flat and schematic rendering of fabric on the back (see fig. 7.4b)—evidently not substantially manipulated during the wax-working phase—with the complex pattern of folds and creases on the front. In discussing the drapery worn by the bronze portrait of Antonia Minor from Herculaneum, Lahusen and Formigli suggested that actual textile was used in its creation.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is also a possibility for the Tiberius, but cannot be proven. What does seem likely, however, is that some sections of the statue’s drapery were created entirely from scratch—in other words, using the &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; lost-wax technique. Seen from below, the undercuts between the folds that hang from the left hand are not as thin or uniform in thickness as other sections of the drapery. Furthermore, the spaces between each fold, which should be empty, are partially filled. This contrasts with other areas of drapery on the statue, and the most plausible means of achieving this would have been by shaping this section directly by hand. Therefore, although the production of the Tiberius must have involved numerous molds—what would conventionally be called an &lt;em&gt;indirect&lt;/em&gt; lost-wax casting—it is better to understand its creation as a composite of indirect and direct techniques, as need required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation-for-casting&#34;&gt;Preparation for Casting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further and probably intentional consequence of this approach was to allow for the simplification of the casting process and, thereafter, the reassembly of the different bronze elements. To divide the statue into 62 pieces entailed more than 100 strategic incisions in the wax working-model, mostly along the deep recesses within the drapery folds. Such an operation was not undertaken haphazardly, but rather with substantial planning, and the advantages were multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having created separate pieces during the elaboration of the wax-working model, the bronze-workers could take advantage of these subdivisions when it came to cutting the model into individual parts for casting. Furthermore, by dividing the figure so extensively, the founders could work with pieces that were manageable in size and thus easy to handle. Working with smaller sections also meant that a smaller firing pit could be employed, permitting an economical use of both materials and fuel. Most importantly, the multiple subdivisions of the wax working-model not only produced smaller shapes, but simpler ones, which reduced the risk of casting flaws. This can be demonstrated with the drapery on the front of the statue. In cross section, the folds of the toga are highly complex three-dimensional forms (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.5a&lt;/strong&gt;). These undulations and curves would have been troublesome to cast. By subdividing such sections into numerous individual components (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.5b&lt;/strong&gt;), the founders could work instead with a series of curved sheets or “half-open” shapes. These would have been easier to prepare for casting, for there was no need to create an interior core of refractive material or an external vestiture. Rather, the open forms could simply be enclosed in refractive material (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.5c&lt;/strong&gt;). Though the subdivision of the figure into many pieces and their separate casting might have been more labor-intensive in the short term, it was strategic in the long term, for it increased the likelihood that the cast sections would have been well-made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A surprising feature of the statue’s production can also be explained in this context. During the study of the Tiberius, we identified just six chaplets. At first, this small number seemed remarkable, especially given the statue’s scale, but it can be understood as an additional benefit of dividing the sculpture into numerous “simple” forms. Typically, chaplets are needed in order to prevent slippage between the interior core and the external vestiture during casting. In the case of the Tiberius, because the simple forms were &lt;em&gt;encased&lt;/em&gt; in refractive material, the likelihood of any movement was greatly reduced. Thus chaplets were rendered largely superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founders not only prepared the wax model for casting with great care; it also appears that they sought to perfect the quality of the bronze that they used. The alloy is very low in lead at 89.97 percent copper, 9.36 percent tin, and just 0.39 percent lead. This seems to have been deliberate. Adding lead to the alloy makes it easier to work, providing increased fluidity that is particularly helpful when casting large pieces of bronze. The fact that lead was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; added to the alloy used for the Tiberius could be related to the division of the statue into numerous pieces. As noted above, these parts would have been of manageable size and shape, with no need for the addition of lead to guarantee a successful pour.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;assembly-of-the-bronze-figure&#34;&gt;Assembly of the Bronze Figure**&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the sixty-two constituent pieces are for the front of the figure; the rear, which presumably was never intended to be visible and is much more schematically rendered, is made up of just a dozen parts (see figs 7.4a‒b). Once all of the metal pieces were cast, and sprues and vents removed, the final assembly of the statue could begin. All evidence here points to both efficiency and pragmatism: there are numerous open seams, and just a small number of joins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its finished state, the Tiberius weighs around 454 kilograms (1000 lbs.), so how and where the joins were made would have been critical for the portrait’s structural stability. Rather than laboriously welding the statue piece-by-piece, the founders joined most of the parts together at just ten “zones” of connection. These are visible (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.6&lt;/strong&gt;) in the X-radiographs as areas of greater density, the bronze being thicker on account of the fusion welds. Notably, the alloy used for these joins was of a much higher lead content (15.17%) than that used for the parts of the statue. This must have been intentional, as adding lead to the alloy would have allowed for a lower melting point and improved the flow of the molten metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In studying the X-ray images and the locations of these points of connection, we conclude that the sixty-two pieces of the statue were largely assembled in sections (marked here in yellow)(&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.7&lt;/strong&gt;), as many of the joins occur at points where the drapery folds meet. Thus, individual pieces would have been placed side-by-side and then fusion-welded only where they converge. There was no need to close each and every seam, and many were instead left open (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 7.8&lt;/strong&gt;). Because of the careful preparation of the wax working-model, these open seams are all but invisible today, lying deep within the folds of the drapery. This economical method of joining was employed not only for the complex folds of drapery, but also for the body parts. Thus the head is attached at just four points: two where the neck contacts the tunic, and at another two where the mantle meets the crown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;surface-treatment&#34;&gt;Surface Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the statue was fully assembled, any defects on the surface could be rectified. A number of post-casting repairs, such as cold patches, are visible, but they are relatively few, indicating that the casting was successful. As a final step, the surface of the statue may also have been treated, although the eighteenth-century cleaning severely compromises our understanding of the bronze’s ancient appearance. In studying one of the deepest recesses of drapery, however, we did encounter a smooth black surface. Under high magnification, this showed very fine parallel lines that are shallower and more numerous than those created by the tools used to clean the statue in the eighteenth century. These lines could indicate that a pumice or another fine abrasive application was used to finish the bronze in antiquity. The black color provides evidence for copper sulfides, potentially chalcocite (Cu~2~S). It may be the result of natural corrosion phenomena typical in the volcanic soil of the Bay of Naples, or it may indicate the application of sulfuric vapors or liquids to color the surface. If so, the portrait would have been a lustrous dark gray or black.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The techniques used to produce the portrait of Tiberius, from its conception in wax to its translation and reassembly in bronze, highlight the Roman bronze-workers’ ingenuity and pragmatism in achieving a naturalistic sculptural composition, while at the same time increasing the probability of a successful casting. Most significant in this regard is the discovery that the statue was composed of such a large number of parts. Comparison with other large bronzes—most obviously those from Herculaneum—suggest that the Tiberius is exceptional. By comparison, Lahusen and Formigli distinguished 22 parts for the Livia, 19 for the Antonia Minor, and 15 for one of the Agrippina Minor statues.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Other large-scale, heavily draped bronzes are scarce, but around 26 separate parts have been documented for the Victoria of Brescia,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and at least 29 for the Marcus Aurelius in Cleveland.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In sum, therefore, the 62 parts used to create the Tiberius are roughly double what might be expected. The counts for the other statues just mentioned could prove to be underestimates. How else might we explain the quantity of pieces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though many of the other large Herculaneum bronzes are imperial portraits, Najbjerg has proposed that the Tiberius was initially conceived of in isolation.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This could account for its complexity: the status of the commission may have warranted a more advanced level of production. More superficially, the richness of the drapery could be the reason for the quantity of pieces; simply put, the portrait of Tiberius is a more elaborate composition than the other large bronzes cited above. Or perhaps equating sixty-two parts with “complexity” is to miss the point. For though it involved substantial forethought and labor, separating the wax working-model into so many pieces increased the likelihood that the finished product would have been a success. Firstly, casting the pieces would have been easier, as they would have been smaller and simpler to handle, and the risk of flaws reduced. Secondly, because the subdivisions of the wax working-model had been carefully planned, the bronze-workers could assemble the cast pieces in sections, using just a few focused points for fusion welding. Finally, because many of the divisions between the parts run along recesses of the drapery folds, their open seams could be hidden. So while sixty-two parts may at first betoken a complex production process, this is better understood as a means of guaranteeing a successful outcome: multiplicity translates into simplicity. In this light, our Tiberius of many parts offers a valuable lesson in Roman risk-reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Piombino Apollo has recently undergone new studies of its production, measurements, alloy, and associated inscriptions (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.1&lt;/strong&gt;, left). That statue and the similar Apollo from Pompeii (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.1&lt;/strong&gt;, right) were installed side-by-side for the first time in the exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt;, which made it possible to compare and contrast the two figures and to raise new questions about their similarities and differences.The Piombino Apollo was discovered underwater and sold at Livorno in 1832; in 1834 it was acquired by the Louvre.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On the statue’s left foot, in capital letters, the phrase “&amp;hellip; ος Αθαναια δεκαταν” (&amp;hellip; os dedicated this as a tithe to Athena) was cut in the metal after casting&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and inlaid with silver. The image’s peculiar style led to debate over its date that continued until 1967, when Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway argued persuasively that the Piombino Apollo was made in the late Hellenistic period.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Inside the statue were four fragments of a lead tablet, three of which were exhibited in &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt;. The lead strips are inscribed with another phrase, in handwriting similar to that on the foot, partially preserving the names of its sculptors: “&amp;hellip; ηνοδο &amp;hellip; φων Ροδ[ι]ος εποo &amp;hellip;” ([M]enodotos and &amp;hellip; phon of Rhodes made it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Menodotos of Tyre founded a workshop in Rhodes, for which three generations of his family are recorded, ranging in date from 150 BC to perhaps 50 BC, and two of his descendants also bore the name Menodotos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These dates have suggested to some that the bronze image from Piombino might have been dedicated to Athena Lindia in Rhodes during the last quarter of the second century BC, and that it was shipped to Italy at some later date.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Sophie Descamps-Lequime has asked, however, whether a statue of a god could be dedicated to another god,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and this leads to the question of whether this kouros necessarily represents Apollo. That is, in what sense might an archaizing kouros be recognized as a statue of that god and yet actually have been dedicated to Athena. One might even ask whether the statue’s buyer believed that this was an Archaic statue, as did many modern scholars. Furthermore, the bronze from Piombino may not have been produced in Rhodes. Menodotos himself came from Tyre, and inscriptions record works by his family-members in Halikarnassos, in Athens, and in Delphi. A versatile family, they produced at least three different types of works: an athletic group, portrait statues, and the archaizing Piombino bronze.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This image is of very high quality, with delicate detailing of the hair, gracefully curving inlaid copper brows and lips, inlaid copper nipples, and almost no evidence of bubbles, patches, or other repairs, beyond the possible repair of one toe.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1978, excavation at Pompeii in the House of Gaius Julius Polybius (IX 13.1–3) uncovered in the triclinium identified as EE a bronze image bearing remarkable similarities to the Piombino (see fig. 8.1, right).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This bronze, however, is also said to have been standing on a small round molded base. Seeing the two bronzes exhibited side-by-side has led to a number of new general observations, although detailed comparisons are hampered by the fact that no systematic study of the Pompeii bronze has yet been undertaken. Nonetheless, new measurements have been made of both statues at the same points and with the same instruments.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The most important difference between the two is that the Pompeii bronze is significantly taller (by about 12.5 cm, or just over 5 in.) than the Piombino. This discrepancy in height may be explained by the fact that joining limbs to bodies or heads to necks can easily affect measurements as well as overall configuration. Furthermore, in 28 of 36 measurements taken of the two, the Pompeii bronze is between 1 millimeter and 5.6 centimeters (up to 2 &amp;frac12; in.) larger than the Piombino; it is 1 to 9 millimeters (up to 3/8 in.) smaller at five points; and the two bronzes are equal in only three measurements.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two statues are, however, of precisely the same Hellenistic type: they are archaizing kouroi with the left foot slightly forward; and both have highly decorative features. In addition, the profiles of the two bronzes strongly suggest that they are based on the same basic model or on two versions of that basic model, which would account for the differences: the Pompeii statue’s neck is thicker and more cylindrical, and the torso is bulkier, whereas those features on the Piombino are more delicately modeled; the right buttock of the Pompeii bronze is farther back than the left one, and the Piombino’s buttocks are aligned, but his feet are farther apart than those of the Pompeii bronze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many differences in surface details, such as in the rendering of the hair and facial features. The bronze from Pompeii has wavy locks, each finely combed, radiating from the crown of his head; there are rows of snail-shell curls and spiral locks on his forehead; his long hair is knotted at the back of the neck in a broad bun; he wears a diadem and a tiara ornamented with upright lotuses and palmettes; and the two neatly arranged fillets emerging from behind his ears are neatly splayed across either side of his chest. The Piombino bronze has wavy finely combed hair radiating from the crown of his head, a row of roughly delineated curlicue locks on his forehead, parts of a diadem visible behind the ears with wavy locks folded symmetrically over it, and the longer hair beneath that is tied in a four-part knot at the nape of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many and perhaps all of the individualizing features were added on the wax working models, resulting in different editions of the same basic model for an archaizing youth. If so, why are the measurements so different? And why is the Piombino bronze a nearly flawless casting, whereas there are many small rectangular patches on the Pompeii bronze recording the repair of casting flaws?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, all we can say for certain is that the similarities between the two bronzes cannot be coincidental. There was surely a basic model for this particular kouros, and copies of that model, as of any popular type, would have been owned by more than one workshop. If so, such bronzes might have been commissioned in different times and at different places, the Piombino between approximately 150 BC and 50 BC, perhaps on Rhodes or perhaps not, and the other in Pompeii at some date before AD 79. At the same time, because each bronze was carefully individualized in the wax, each of them is undoubtedly one of a kind, representing a different edition of the basic model. They are both more decorative than pious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Piombino is likely to have been conceived and recognized as an archaistic statue, given its significant departures from Archaic standards, particularly in the hairstyle. But it poses a number of questions. Was it dedicated to Athena, or was the inscription cut on top of the foot a form of artifice, like the style of the statue? Why were the names of the artisans hidden on a lead tablet inside the statue? And does the slightly flattened left forearm reveal that the wax model was made to support a tray?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pompeii bronze is usually described as probably having once held a phiale and a bow, the floral tray-supports that he was holding at the time of discovery being identified tentatively as a sign of later adaptation for use in the triclinium in which the image was found.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is a hole in the statue’s right palm, beside which is marked “III”; another mark cut on the back of the attachment for one of the floral supports appears to read “VIII” or “III”.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Did these numbers guide the assembly, ensuring that workmen chose attachments that would fit the statues? There are no signs of solder having been used to fix the attachments in place. To those scholars who would prefer to think that this image started its existence as a statue, it is possible that when the image was not in use as a server, the tray or lamp could have been replaced by other fittings, such as a phiale and a bow. Thus the tray-holder would become a statue, the tray could be cleaned, a pitcher polished, a lamp refilled with oil. Perhaps this Graeco-Roman archaistic statue-type had been created to serve a dual function, as a statue and as a tray-holder, the attributes changed as the situation demanded. The highly decorative details of both bronzes suggest that they were made as fine furnishings that took the form of Archaic statues, a style that never fell from favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence of such furnishings can be found in literary sources. Entering the palace of the Phaiakian king Alkinoos, Odysseus crosses a bronze threshold; there are silver columns and lintel, golden doors with a golden handle, and gold and silver guard-dogs. Where the Phaiakians gathered for the evening’s entertainment, “there were golden youths (χρύςειοι κοῡροι), holding in their hands blazing torches, and standing on the strong-compounded bases, to shed a gleam through the house by night, and to shine on the banqueters” (Homer &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; 7.100–102).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lucretius, who preferred natural pleasures, disdainfully recalled these Homeric lines, scoffing at the “golden images around the house of youths (&lt;em&gt;aurea simulacra&lt;/em&gt;) holding flaming torches in their right hands to light banquets that last into the night”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:De-rerum-natura-2-24-26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:De-rerum-natura-2-24-26&#34;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, in fact, numerous statues that are known today as silent butlers, a designation that might have inspired Lucretius to further criticism. They are all bronzes, all ephebes, and they range broadly through archaizing and classicizing styles, many of them standing on small round bases. Like real children, they are all diminutive in size. Their extended or raised hands, now devoid of their detachable accessories, have given rise to lively and continuing debate about their identity. I will examine these in turn, including one depicted in a wall-painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-citharist&#34;&gt;The Citharist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October of 1853, the clearing of a street in Pompeii was interrupted by a mudslide that exposed a large house (I 4.1–3), which was actually two houses joined together, with entrances on both the Via Stabiana and the Via dell’Abbondanza. In early November of the same year, the diggers found a bronze statue of a youth&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in what was later identified as the southeast corner of the south peristyle courtyard, adjacent to a large triclinium (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.2&lt;/strong&gt;). Excavations in the house were halted for five years; when they began again in 1858, the House of the Citharist was given its name, deriving from the identification of the statue as an Apollo who had once held a cithara.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The male figure, an ephebe early Classical in style, stands on a molded bronze base that is just large enough for his feet. He has long hair divided into finely striated (as if combed) wavy locks radiating from the crown of his head, parted in the middle of the forehead, and rolled around a diadem. There are delicate comma-like curls on the back of the neck, and two long thick curly locks escape from behind each ear and fall to the shoulder blades.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The boy’s eyes are inset in bone or ivory and stone; the nipples are inlaid with copper. He looks down in the general direction of his raised left hand, into the palm of which is fitted a rectangular plaque with two curious features: half of an elongated oval on one side; and something that resembles a keyhole beside it, perhaps a notch. In the lowered right hand he holds a thick curved object that is slightly longer than the width of his hand: it is rounded, curving, and tapered toward the back, with hollows on either side of the thicker end. That object has always been identified as a plectrum, the rectangle in the other palm as the vertical arm of a cithara, and the youth himself as a prepubescent Apollo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lyre and the cithara both have arms that rise from the sides of the instrument’s body, the strings attached to a crossbar at the top. The cithara is larger than the lyre; a tortoiseshell may form the back of a lyre. Both instruments are associated with Apollo, and both were plucked with the fingers or with a plectrum,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a small flat piece of shell, horn, or metal that does not resemble the thick object that this statue is holding in his right hand. The rectangular object in the left hand has not yet been identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ephebe&#34;&gt;The Ephebe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five years after the Citharist was found, in 1925, less than two blocks away on the Via dell’Abbondanza, Amedeo Maiuri excavated a very large home (I 7.11) consisting of several conjoined houses with three entrances. Another small bronze youth was excavated there; it became known as the Ephebe from the Via dell’Abbondanza,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the house was soon named the House of the Ephebe (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.3&lt;/strong&gt;). The statue was found at the entrance to a hallway connecting an atrium and a tablinum, where it and other objects were thought to have been in storage during a renovation project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the previous image, this bronze is slightly under 150 centimeters (59 in.) in height. He too stands on a small round molded-bronze base, this one mounted on a round marble footed base. In his left hand he held a floral support for a tray. This ephebe has essentially the same hairstyle as the one found nearby, even the little comma-like curls on the back of his neck, lacking only the long spiral sidelocks. The similarities between the two boys—in size, in identity, early classicizing design, in their small round bases—could well mean that they were both products of the same Pompeiian workshop. Was the “citharist” also a tray- or lamp-bearer? Had his tray been temporarily removed, allowing him to function as a statue? It would be no surprise to find similar rich furnishings in two fine houses located only two blocks apart on the same street. Scholars might wish to consider what else these two bronzes have in common. Were they made in the same way? Do their arms and legs and heads have comparable measurements? Is the copper alloy similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-youth-from-house-of-marcus-fabius-rufus&#34;&gt;The Youth from House of Marcus Fabius Rufus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1960, a fleshy bronze youth, late Classical in style, poised gracefully on an elaborate base, was excavated at Pompeii, in the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus, the location unspecified (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.4&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The height of the statue on its base is 137 or 139 centimeters (ca. 54 in.), of the figure alone 122 centimeters (48 in.). He has long thickly curled luxuriant hair, a fleshy face, and a soft effeminate body. The object he once held aloft in his right hand is now missing, but it may have been a wine-cup, because his left hand held tray supports in the form of grapevines, suggesting that the bearer is a young Bacchus. He is usually identified, but without explanation, as a statue that was repurposed as a lampstand (&lt;em&gt;lampadēphoros&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;lychnophoros&lt;/em&gt;). On the contrary, it seems more likely that this too was intended as a piece of furniture, designed in the form of a statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idolino&#34;&gt;The Idolino&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Idolino, now in Florence, was found in 1530 at Pesaro (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.5&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The bronze youth was initially identified as a statue by Myron, or, more widely, by Polykleitos, and an elaborate highly decorated base was made for him by Sebastiano Serlio during the 1530s, to which his small round ancient base was affixed. Little attention was paid to the tray-support made of grapevines that was found with the statue. Mario Iozzo has aptly described the Idolino not as a Roman version of a Classical statue, but rather as a “vaguely Polykleitan” piece of furniture.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-ephebe-in-a-pompeiian-wall-painting&#34;&gt;An Ephebe in a Pompeiian Wall-painting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A classicizing statue of a naked ephebe is barely visible standing in the lower right-hand corner of a Pompeiian wall-painting, his feet on a small round base, his lower arms outstretched to hold a large rectangular tray (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To his left and beside a three-legged round table stands a representation of an actual servant, also a boy, but dressed in a tunic. Larger mature diners recline behind them, one of them reaching forward for an item on the table. The scene recalls banquet scenes on Greek red-figure vases, in which men reclining on couches are served wine by naked boys with wine-pitchers. These were not meant to be statues, but in Roman dining-rooms silent butlers could stand alongside the actual servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bronze youths may have held lights in a raised hand, or trays on outstretched arms with hors d’oeuvres or cups of wine. The trays are lost, but we can imagine the finest of them, thanks to Pliny the Elder, who writes that citrus-wood tables were as popular with ladies as were pearls with gentlemen. He describes the variety of veining in the citrus-wood, noting that its color gleamed like the wine that was set upon it, and that it was not even damaged by spills (&lt;em&gt;Naturalis historia&lt;/em&gt; 13.91–99). Cicero paid 500,000 sesterces for a citrus table, and Gallus Asinius, consul in 8 BC, paid a million sesterces for one. When not in use, a tray and its supports could be removed, the tray-bearer or cupbearer becoming a statue of an ephebe or a youthful Bacchus, to whose hands alternative accessories might be attached. Indeed, there is no evidence that trays and their supports were permanently pinned or soldered to the hands and forearms of these youths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three-dimensional images, appointments for the luxury household, recall the Greek traditions represented on red-figure vases that were admired and emulated by the Romans: serving-boys with tables, trays, pitchers, attending to gentlemen at dinner. Perhaps because the luxury arts have always been difficult for scholars to accept as major arts, there is reluctance to accept the fact that a beloved image like the Idolino is not a famous statue or a derivative of one, but a piece of furniture. Homer and Lucretius called them golden boys—and some of them held lamps, others held trays. They functioned as fine furniture, and they were available in a variety of archaic and classical styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;marathon-boy&#34;&gt;Marathon Boy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An elegantly posed bronze ephebe was netted by fishermen in 1925 near the beach in the Bay of Marathon, with no other finds and no trace of a shipwreck (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.7&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The figure was nearly intact, missing only the front of the right foot, which had been separately cast, and a piece of the left heel. Ever since, scholars have argued over what the youth once held on the flattened palm of his left hand, at which he is looking so intently. The Marathon Boy’s right hand is raised, the wrist bent, the thumb and forefinger touching each other, again as if he is holding something. But what was it? Was he pouring liquid into a bowl? Picking fruit and putting it in a bowl? Holding a child, or perhaps a tortoiseshell lyre? Was he holding a box from which he was taking a ribbon? A top? Or was he snapping the fingers of his right hand? Who is he? Is he a young Hermes? Or does the fillet with the leaflike tab at the middle identify him as an athlete?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have imagined that the arms had broken off and were restored in Roman times, when he was turned into a lamp-bearer.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But there is no evidence to support this conjecture. The statue was nearly intact when found, with his arms, legs, and head in place. The only point upon which scholars generally agree is that the style is Praxitelean, late fourth-century, or perhaps early Hellenistic. Was he actually made at that time, or was he a later production, made in the ever-popular Classical style?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was the Marathon Boy on a ship bound for Italy? Nothing else was found nearby. Why would a ship have jettisoned this bronze in the bay, close to the beach? Could the ephebe have been associated in some way with the sumptuous villa of Herodes Atticus at Marathon, dating to the second century AD? The sculptures in his personal collections were of the highest quality. And so is this figure, though even today we know very little about it. As to its manufacture, we know only what we can see on the surface: the joins of the arms, made with oval flow-welds, appear to be the original joins; they are of a type that is typically found on both Greek and Roman bronzes; and they are in their usual location, below the shoulders, unpatched. One detail that has not been explored is the intentional hole in the left palm, within which there is a cast-in sturdy round pin, well-suited to holding a large object (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 8.8&lt;/strong&gt;). Furthermore, both the hand and the lower arm were flattened in the wax before casting. Did he hold a tray of wine-cups for guests of Herodes Atticus, an oinochoe in his raised right hand? Ridgway had already suggested in 1997 that he might be a server.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:27&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now this seems likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might ask ourselves what deserves consideration as a statue. If the Marathon Boy were a tray-bearer, could he not also be a statue? As we look at these once-gleaming bronze ephebes with outstretched arms, we might remember that the well-made “golden boys” are first brought to our attention by Homer in the Palace of Alkinoos, and that the genre enjoyed great popularity in sumptuous Roman homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:10&#34;&gt;I am grateful to Kenneth Lapatin and Jens Daehner for taking many new measurements of both the Piombino bronze and the Pompeii bronze in October 2015.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:11&#34;&gt;Two of the equal measurements are in the heights of the ears, which are likely to have been added separately in wax. However, the ears of the two bronzes do not seem to be the same. For other bronzes on which the joining of similar parts led to rather different results, see the pairs of mirror-image fountain figures from the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum: Mattusch 2005, 296–315.
