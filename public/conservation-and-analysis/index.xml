&lt;p&gt;##Introduction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation Science is a field that has been in continuous evolution since the late twentieth century. The study of ancient bronzes has long focused on archaeometry, addressing technological aspects and production concerns. Casting cores, alloys, joins, surface patinas, and corrosion products have been intensively investigated by various analytical techniques in order to improve our knowledge of the original materials, processes, manufacturing techniques, and degradation phenomena. Scientific results provided very useful information to archaeologists, art historians, and conservators about the artistry, craftsmanship, production, conservation, and restoration of ancient bronze artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, ecological, economic, and social aspects must also be considered when looking at the solutions that scientific research could bring in this field. Taking these new obligations into account, it is clear that a certain number of best practices must be reevaluated and new studies in the field of conservation are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the processes that lead to deterioration is a fundamental element of the concept of conservation. Immediately after its manufacture, any object starts to interact with the atmosphere and the environment, and is subject to increasing stress due to normal use. With few exceptions, all metals are subject to corrosion by chemical reaction with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, corrosion effects on historic and artistic artifacts can be seen as positive, as for example when a patina is considered aesthetically pleasant; in most cases, however, corrosion produces irreversible damage resulting in the loss of specific values (historic, artistic, scientific, social, etc.) of the object.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Corrosion induces alteration of the original patinas, and continuous deterioration results in irreplaceable loss of details. A metal may suffer from two different types of corrosion: “dry corrosion,” usually in the form of a thin surface patination or tarnishing, and “aqueous corrosion,” where the metal is attacked more vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bronze-disease-a-post-burial-degradation-phenomenon&#34;&gt;“Bronze Disease”: A Post-burial Degradation Phenomenon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Degradation processes occur as the object reacts to its archaeological burial and post-excavation environments (storage or exhibition). These reactions represent a big challenge for the conservation of metallic artworks, especially in the case of ancient bronzes. Copper-based artifacts may suffer from a pronounced electrochemical corrosion caused mainly by the presence of unstable species (chlorine) that could induce active cyclic copper corrosion, also known as “bronze disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the framework of several international and national projects carried out in the last decade,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; we investigated the corrosion products of a large number of ancient bronze artifacts excavated in the Mediterranean Basin as a function of the chemical composition, the metallurgical features of the alloy, the archaeological context, and the post-burial degradation. The chemical, physical, morphological, and metallurgical characterization of bronzes sampled in different conservation conditions was performed by means of scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and optical microscopy (OM). The results provided good insight into the corrosion layers and evidenced the nearly universal presence of chlorine as cuprous chloride (CuCl). A complex micro-chemical structure of the corrosion products, grown during the long archaeological burial, was frequently detected. The most common copper corrosion products are listed in &lt;strong&gt;table 35.1&lt;/strong&gt;; the dangerous basic chlorides resulting from “bronze disease” are marked with asterisks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term stability of Cu-based artworks is deeply affected by the cyclic copper (Cu) corrosion induced by air exposure (RH&amp;gt;35%) of the reactive cuprous chloride (CuCl) that is located at the interface between external corrosion products and the surviving core metal matrix(&lt;strong&gt;fig. 35.1a&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Pitting corrosion attacks develop underneath the corrosion products, deep in internal areas of the alloy, with typical pinpoint forms (pits) or craters, and only later appear on the surface. At this point, the state of conservation of the artifacts is irremediably compromised (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 35.1b&lt;/strong&gt;), and an appropriate stabilization intervention is necessary to prevent further damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results of the XPS curve-fitting of the Cu 2p~3/2~ photoelectron peak from the surface of a pure bronze alloy and from various archaeological artifacts corroded by “bronze disease” are shown here &lt;strong&gt;(fig. 35.2)&lt;/strong&gt;. In a pure bronze alloy, the Cu 2p~3/2~ photoelectron signal consists of a single component centered at a binding energy (BE) value around 932.0 eV, that is assigned to Cu^0^, Cu^+1^ species on the surface (see fig. 35.2a). In corroded bronze samples, the presence of a second component located at BE = 934.5 eV in the XPS Cu 2p~3/2~ spectrum clearly indicates a fraction of Cu^+2^ species on the surface, whose relative quantity is related to the extent of corrosion suffered by the ancient bronzes (see fig. 35.2b–c).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conservation-requirements&#34;&gt;Conservation Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restoration and conservation of ancient metals can be carried out by specialists in different ways. However, the identification of an appropriate project of restoration, addressing specific and defined problems of deterioration, is not a simple task. A huge bibliography has developed regarding the relevance, reversibility, and efficacy of traditional and modern methods, products, and materials for restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various strategies can be used to prevent or reduce corrosion. Since the physical nature of the historic or artistic object cannot be changed, the modification of the environment should be the first choice: preventive conservation strategies involve no action on the object itself (passive techniques) and are therefore preferable from the point of view of current conservation ethics.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In outdoor environments, this approach is very difficult to implement: atmospheric humidity cannot be controlled, so the main conservation method consists of protecting the artifacts from direct precipitation&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and keeping them under constant maintenance. This strategy is more easily applied in indoor environments, such as museums, where the microclimate (relative humidity, temperature, lighting, and pollution) can be controlled. But even there it is sometimes not economical or practical to act on the environment, especially for objects kept in storage. In this case conservation science offers protocols to either protect the metal surface from contact with the environment and/or reduce the electrochemical reaction rates (active techniques).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the conservation of metals, one of the most difficult tasks is the stabilization of copper-based alloys coming from archaeological artifacts or from artworks in indoor or outdoor exhibitions. Generally, the treatment consists of the following steps: pre-consolidation; mechanical/chemical/electrochemical/physical cleaning; washings and soluble salts control; dehydration and final stabilization, commonly by using 1-H benzotriazole (BTA) as a corrosion inhibitor. Control in a humidity chamber; consolidation; assembly; filling; surface coating; and mount-making are subsequent treatments to complete a restoration process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stabilization of a bronze artifact to slow the natural process of corrosion is one of the most difficult phases of the metal conservation process. The treatment options are varied and can work directly on the pitting phenomenon or on the extraction, to the extent possible, of chlorides before adding chemicals to the system to prevent cyclic corrosion and to prolong the life of the ancient bronzes. Many chemical products can form a protective layer of molecular thickness that prevents the metal from reacting with the environment. Other chemicals, acting as corrosion inhibitors, may take the form of deposits or films that form over the metal, passivating it&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and hence preventing any further corrosion; or they may work as vapors (vapor phase inhibitors, or VPIs)&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by bombarding the metal with molecules.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the first papers dealing with the BTA application for copper appeared in the late 1960s,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the number of scientific studies on the application of corrosion inhibitors to bronze heritage conservation has increased hugely and their quality has significantly improved, especially in the last fifteen years. Nevertheless, the conventional method used by restorers world-wide for the stabilization of the active corrosion of copper-based artifacts involves ethanolic solutions of BTA as a corrosion inhibitor. These BTA solutions, often concentrated (3–6 wt.%) and heated to 60°C, are usually applied to the objects by brushing, immersion, or spraying. After treatment the object is lacquered to prevent the physical rupture of BTA films and contamination by dirt and sweat. Since BTA is destabilized by UV light, a special commercially available lacquer (Incralac) is commonly used because it contains a reserve of BTA and also a UV screening agent (Paraloid B44 + BTA 3%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even though it has been extensively used as a copper corrosion inhibitor, BTA has not always proved effective. Furthermore, BTA is highly toxic and a suspected carcinogen, representing a severe health and environmental risk.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since environmental concerns and the safety of conservators should be prioritized in the conservation of cultural heritage, hazardous materials should no longer be used in daily practice. Instead, wherever possible, safe alternatives using environmentally friendly and sustainable materials and processes should be employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stabilization and protection of heritage metals have specific needs and requirements and, necessarily, all the scientific studies on corrosion inhibitors for this application should address and follow these specifications. Commercial corrosion inhibitors satisfy some of these requirements, and in most cases the inhibitor protective layers are transparent. Unfortunately, in other cases, application of the inhibitors produces visible changes. In addition, due to their low thickness, they are susceptible to mechanical removal, so they must in many cases be used in combination with protective coatings, which increase the barrier effect of the whole system. The combination of different inhibitors seems to be a promising way to take advantage of their synergetic effects and to reduce the dosage of chemicals. Still, the toxicity of bronze corrosion inhibitors remains an open question that urgently needs a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recent-advancements-in-material-science&#34;&gt;Recent Advancements in Material Science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, research activities in our group at CNR-ISMN were devoted to studies of archaeological bronzes in order to find conservation strategies tailored to their chemical composition, structure, archaeological sites, and degradation mechanisms.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Our scientific approach, represented schematically in &lt;strong&gt;fig. 35.3&lt;/strong&gt;, started with the identification of the degradation agents and mechanisms based on a large-scale diagnostic investigation of different bronze artifacts selected from several archaeological sites of the Mediterranean Basin. These scientific results were extremely important for the production of sustainable nanostructured materials with corrosion inhibition properties to be used as possible alternatives to BTA. In order to test their efficacy as corrosion inhibitors, reference bronze alloys and artificially corroded samples were also produced as sacrificial materials.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Only the most promising and low- or nontoxic materials resulting from our tests were then submitted to the final validation performed by a conservator on a real ancient bronze artifact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;experimental-conditions&#34;&gt;Experimental Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference and/or commercial bronze alloys were used as metallic substrates, after mechanical polishing by silicon carbide abrasive papers with different roughness. Formulations of synthetic or naturally-derived products were prepared in ethanol solutions. Films were produced by immersion of the bronze substrate for 2 hours at room temperature. The corrosion treatment was performed by immersion for 2 hours in an aqueous solution of NaCl 3% wt. A detailed surface and electrochemical investigation was performed by using XPS and SEM/EDX, and potentiodynamics and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. Toxicity studies were carried out by assessment of the acute toxicity (LD50) after oral administration or injection to a population of cavies, according to standard pharmacological protocols. Furthermore, the viability of human bronchial and epithelial cells was tested after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;organic-corrosion-inhibitors&#34;&gt;Organic Corrosion Inhibitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to find a possible substitute for BTA, we synthesized different functionalized organic compounds with protective and/or inhibition properties for the conservation of archaeological bronzes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the molecular design of a new organic compound, containing nitrogen and/or sulfur moieties (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 35.4&lt;/strong&gt;), there were certain requirements to be fulfilled for application as corrosion inhibitor. The ideal molecule should have high efficiency in the inhibition of bronze corrosion, low toxicity, environmental-friendly behavior, and long-term stability. Since this product is meant to be applied on real archaeological bronzes, other conservation requirements needed to be considered, such as the preservation of the aesthetic value, the ease of application, and long-term performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large number of chemical compounds belonging to different classes of organic molecules (e.g. imidazoles, malonamides, oxalamides, aminoalcohols, aminopyrroles) were purposely synthesized for application in bronze conservation. Unfortunately, we encountered many failures, due to (1) synthetic problems (accessibility of reagents, difficult synthetic routes, low yield of the product), (2) low solubility, (3) the formation of a colored solution, (4) the toxicity of the molecule, and (5) the cost of the production. Since this strategy of chemical synthesis proved to be very time-consuming, with too many requirements to be fulfilled and, consequently, with a high risk of failures, we tried to follow a different approach by investigating natural compounds extracted from the seeds of endemic plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;green-corrosion-inhibitors&#34;&gt;“Green” Corrosion Inhibitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using eco-friendly compounds derived from extracts as “green” corrosion inhibitors represents a very up-to-date trend.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They are readily available, usually environmentally friendly, and also biocompatible. Unfortunately, they have a complex chemical nature that, together with the complexity of the heritage bronzes, makes it difficult to understand the mechanisms of protection and/or inhibition or the reasons for their failure. In this field of scientific research, a fundamental screening of literature data should be performed according to what part of the natural species is considered. Essential oils or extracts from the seeds or from leaves yield different chemical compositions which in turn result in different performances and properties. In our laboratories we focused on new formulation based on oil extracted from the seeds of plants widely available in the Mediterranean Basin (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 35.5&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New formulations based on the oil extracted from the seed of &lt;em&gt;Opuntia ficus indica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/em&gt; seeds were investigated for bronze corrosion in a marine environment (3% NaCl solution).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Opuntia ficus indica&lt;/em&gt; formulation performed best, and the product was regularly licensed. Our good result allowed the application of this formulation, which is green in color, on some bronzes from the Roman collection of the Archaeological Museum of Rabat (Morocco), which are on display in the exhibition rooms in good conservation conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;smart-self-healing-coatings&#34;&gt;Smart “Self-healing” Coatings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the encountered problems (solubility, colored solutions, toxicity, etc.) that limited or excluded the possible application of some chemicals and formulations on archaeological items, we decided to use a totally different scientific approach: using suitable nanocontainers of corrosion inhibitor to reduce BTA toxicity for the production of smart coatings, as schematically represented in &lt;strong&gt;fig. 35.6&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies of encapsulation, delivery, and release of various materials (e.g. drugs, oils, or perfumes) are among the most rapidly developing areas of modern materials science, biotechnology, nanomedicine, and cosmetics. A key point is the development of nanocontainers able to effectively encapsulate the desired active materials, successfully maintaining them in the inner cavity over long time periods, and preventing their leakage into the environment. An immediate or prolonged release of the encapsulated active material can be triggered by specific changes in the external environment or directly in the container shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halloysite clay (Al~2~Si~2~O~5~(OH)4·&lt;em&gt;nH~2~O&lt;/em&gt;) nanotubes were investigated as tubular containers of BTA.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They represent one of the most promising materials among other cylindrical nanocontainers, due to their availability, low cost ($4/kg; supply of 50,000 tons per year), environmentally friendly and biocompatible nature, and ease of processing with many polymeric materials.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The release properties of the nanocontainer could be fruitfully used for the delivery and targeting of BTA toward the main active corrosion site. The release of BTA is triggered by the corrosion process, which prevents the spontaneous leakage of the corrosion inhibitor out of the coating. If BTA-loaded nanocontainers are incorporated into an organic matrix, the “smart” coating can act both as protection barrier and corrosion inhibitor. We tested this possibility by using hydroxycellulose as the organic compound, just to check the feasibility of our system.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific literature on bronze corrosion inhibitors is huge, but the vast majority of studies deal with fundamental aspects of corrosion inhibition or industrial applications. Recently, there is an open field of studies in continuous evolution, based on the problem of bronze stabilization by means of eco-compatible and safe new products. In most cases, research is still confined to experimental context and to model surfaces. Usually the inhibitors are applied to pure standard bronze alloys, even though in heritage conservation they would be applied on real ancient surfaces, often over pre-existing corrosion products (or patinas) that have to be preserved with a specific conservation protocol. Advancements are required in the investigation of other properties of the coating, including long-term stability, and in the testing on artificially corroded bronze surfaces, in order to mimic the real behavior of archaeological bronze artifacts. The final validation of these products should be made by the conservator using a specific methodology adapted to the particular needs and conditions of their use on precious ancient bronzes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;x-ray-fluorescence&#34;&gt;X-Ray Fluorescence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is one of many analytical methods used to determine the composition of copper-based metal objects. When used nondestructively, however, care must be taken to understand the principles of this method and thus the significance of the results. XRF analysis involves primary X-rays striking the sample and creating electron vacancies in an inner shell of the atoms; these vacancies are then filled by lower-energy electrons from an outer shell, while producing secondary X-rays. A detector in the XRF instrument measures the energy of these secondary X-rays, which may be identified as coming from specific elements, and the intensity of the peaks, which is proportional to the quantity for each element.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The depth of penetration of the primary X-rays, and opposite direction for secondary X-rays reaching the detector, are limited to millimeters or less, so that alteration of the metal object’s surface may not quantitatively represent the original composition. Many bronze objects may include more than just copper and tin among the many elements that may be identified (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.1&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy difference between specific atomic shells varies between elements, so that secondary X-rays have characteristic transition energies. The strongest X-ray intensity results from an L-shell electron replacing a K-shell vacancy, and is called K&lt;sub&gt;∀&lt;/sub&gt;, while an M-shell electron replacing a K-shell vacancy is called K&lt;sub&gt;Ǝ&lt;/sub&gt;. The replacement of L-shell vacancies by M-shell electrons is called L&lt;sub&gt;∀&lt;/sub&gt;. There are also energy differences among the orbitals within each shell, so the X-ray spectra include separate K&lt;sub&gt;∀1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;∀2&lt;/sub&gt; lines. There are more L-lines than K-lines for metal elements, and there are substantial energy differences between L&lt;sub&gt;∀1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;∀2&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;Ǝ1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;Ǝ2&lt;/sub&gt;, and L.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elemental analysis of copper-based objects requires that the intensity of the primary X-rays be high enough to produce sufficient secondary X-rays for the elements of interest, which for ancient metals include copper (Cu), arsenic (As), tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), silver (Ag), antimony (Sb), gold (Au), and mercury (Hg). To quantify the analytical results, filters may be used to reduce the background signal and increase detection limits and precision. For all XRF spectrometers, energy level and intensity is measured by a detector, and the raw data produced may then be calibrated using standards and appropriate software. The standards must also be of copper-based material, as the ability of the secondary X-rays to reach the detector is affected by the composition of the matrix. Standards with a range of values for the other elements (e.g. copper with 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 percent tin; same for lead and others) are also required to produce the most accurate results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When comparing the different analytical instruments that measure secondary X-rays, there are differences in the size sample that can be accommodated, and the actual area that is analyzed. Scanning electron microscopes and electron microprobes are well known for conducting microanalysis, but in most cases only on small objects that will fit inside the sample chamber. Full-size and desk-top XRF instruments analyze a greater area but also have size limitations, while portable XRF spectrometers have no maximum size limit since they are simply held adjacent to the object. While the detection limits of a pXRF may be an order of magnitude less than for regular XRF spectrometers, this does not affect results for major and minor elements in copper-based metal alloys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations-of-nondestructive-analysis&#34;&gt;Limitations of Nondestructive Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important issue to consider is conducting nondestructive surface analyses on potentially heterogeneous samples. Copper-based metals become patinated, and over time may be seriously degraded on the surface, while conservation often involves metallic-based treatments, thus affecting the composition of the object’s surface. When it is not possible to remove a clean sample for elemental analysis, the analysis of multiple spots can quickly reveal if there is significant variability in composition that is not characteristic of the original cast object. Also, the K/L intensity ratios for elements such as tin and copper have fixed values, but these are noticeably altered by corrosion and those spots with irregular values may be excluded. Ideally in such circumstances, it may be permissible to at least clean a small area for reanalysis. Such cleaning is necessary for artifacts known to have been treated with conservation chemicals that contain zinc or other metal elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-a-portable-x-ray-fluorescence-spectrometer-pxrf&#34;&gt;Using a Portable X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (pXRF)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, a variety of portable XRF spectrometers have been developed,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while just in the last decade commercially-produced models have been marketed by several major companies. In addition to the limitations of nondestructive XRF on potentially heterogeneous materials, the use of portable XRF spectrometers for archaeological applications has raised some issues about the reliability and comparability of different instruments. In recent years, however, it has been recognized that pXRF spectrometers are as consistent and precise as regular models, and developing calibration for different materials allows for direct comparison with analyses by other analytical methods.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At this point, the use of pXRF on archaeological metal materials has become widespread, and its regular users have a better understanding of both its potentials and limitations.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two different models of the pXRF have been used for the projects discussed in this paper, starting with the Bruker III-V+ in 2007, and the Bruker III-SD in 2012.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The differences are that the III-SD model uses a silicon drift detector, which is more sensitive and has better resolution than the Si-PIN detector on the III-V+ model. This results in less analytical time necessary per sample and better element identification from the calibration software. For both, the beam size is 5by7 millimeters, so that a substantial horizontal area is being analyzed. For the analysis of copper-based metals, a filter made of 12 mil Al and 1 mil Ti was used to enhance the precision of the readings, while settings of 40 kV, 1.5 or 4 A, and 30–60 seconds were used to provide a full range of metal element peaks with sufficient responses for consistent precise measurements. Experimental testing of the same spot many times has shown that element concentration differences (variation, precision) between analyses are only a fraction of the actual variation in the object.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyses-of-copper-based-alloys&#34;&gt;Analyses of Copper-Based Alloys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of elemental analysis of copper-based metal artifacts is to determine the quantity of elements intentionally included in the alloy. Results obtained from assemblages of copper-based objects may be used for assessing changes in production technology, access to tin and other metals, consistency in alloying different materials (e.g. tools, weapons, jewelry), and recycling practices. Many such artifacts, whether they are tools, weapons, or jewelry, have great artistic and/or archaeological value and are on display in museums. Even for small numbers of objects, analyses provide proper identification and description for both museum exhibits and publications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is a small bronze head (inv. 1984.6) in the collections of Emory University, for which nondestructive analyses were done on three different spots (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.2&lt;/strong&gt;). All show that copper is by far the major metal, while the amounts of tin, lead, and silver vary significantly. The crown of hair has much more lead (~14%) and tin (~11%) than the lip area, which has only about 1% lead and 3% tin; neither have any silver. The eye area, however, has about 2–3% silver (and about 4% lead and 7% tin). Several more examples of nondestructive elemental composition research using a portable XRF are presented below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bronze-age-sicily&#34;&gt;Bronze Age Sicily&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper-based artifacts have been infrequently found at Copper-Bronze Age sites in Sicily, whether as tools, weapons, or ornaments, and little if any study has been done on their actual composition. Permission was obtained to conduct nondestructive pXRF analysis on the large collection in the Paolo Orsi Museum in Siracusa, and others in Sicily. Two bowls from the site of Caldare (inv. 16290, 16291), were tested on multiple spots on the inside, outside, and separately attached handles (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.3&lt;/strong&gt;). The heavy patina could not be avoided, and the readings for tin on each ranged from 0.7 to 5.7%, and 1.8 to 9.6%. One of the handles had notably more lead (3.0%) and arsenic (0.9%), suggesting a separate initial production process, perhaps with copper from a different source. For a dagger (Caldare inv. 16292), the tin ranges from 1.0 to 7.9% for six spots tested, including a rivet at the base. One spot had a measurable amount of zinc (1.6%), suggesting the use of a preservative. These examples illustrate the limitations of conducting surface analysis on bronzes with heavy patination and/or conservation treatment. Nevertheless, the preliminary results on more than one hundred artifacts analyzed show a great variation in the amount of tin used in the original alloys, which may be explained by tin’s irregular availability in a place so far from any source, and/or the absence of larger-scale production centers and standardized alloying practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;viking-age-norway&#34;&gt;Viking Age Norway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the Viking Age, both bronze and brass were widely used. Nondestructive analyses using a pXRF were conducted in the Stavanger Museum, Norway, to test for any patterns and provide information for the museum’s catalog and display. Among the nearly thirty copper-based objects tested, a cruciform brooch copy stands out as a typical bronze with only tin (9.4%) intentionally added (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.4&lt;/strong&gt;). All other items tested were brass, with zinc ranging from just a few percent to more than twenty, and more than half also had tin and/or lead &lt;strong&gt;(table 36.1&lt;/strong&gt;). The range among the percentages for each of these three elements also supports the likelihood of recycling rather than primary production of brass objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-site-analysis-in-calabria-using-pxrf&#34;&gt;On-site Analysis in Calabria Using pXRF&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a sample should be cleaned prior to compositional analysis, to avoid contamination issues. But for copper-based objects, any “dirt” is not likely to affect significantly the proportions of copper, tin, lead, and other metallic elements other than iron. On-site analyses can therefore produce reliable estimated results that may immediately be shared with the excavation team, local officials, and visitors. At the Greek settlement site of Francavilla Marittima in Calabria, Italy, excavations uncovered a burial (grave 14) with what appeared to be copper-based metal artifacts (objects 999‒1000) (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.5&lt;/strong&gt;). Analyses were conducted at the site the same day, revealing both to be tin bronzes (11 and 13% Sn) with no arsenic, lead, or zinc added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-of-a-native-american-tablet&#34;&gt;Analysis of a Native American Tablet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incised Native American–style metal tablet was found at the near-contact-period Blueberry site (8HG678) in the Kissimmee Valley of south-central Florida &lt;strong&gt;(fig. 36.6&lt;/strong&gt;). Analyses were conducted to determine whether it had been made by the Belle Glade people using native copper (that is, pure, geologically natural copper), or using smelting and casting technology, which was introduced to North America after European contact. Multiple spot analyses on both sides by pXRF showed virtually pure copper, more so than for typical smelted copper artifacts, which often have some iron, calcium, and other elements left from the slag. It also would have been more likely that the use of European-produced metal would have come from an alloy rather than pure copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bronzes-in-florida-art-museums&#34;&gt;“Bronzes” in Florida Art Museums&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Greek, Roman, Latin American, and other metal artifacts on display in museums in the United States were acquired through purchase or by donation, and not from excavations, so there are questions about their original archaeological context as well as their authenticity. Using a pXRF, nearly all metal artifacts in the Tampa Museum of Art (80 objects, mostly Greek and Roman) and the Orlando Museum of Art (125 South American objects) were analyzed to assess authenticity and in all cases to provide compositional information for display labels and future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Tampa Museum, two northern Greek bracelets (TMA 1996.024.001/2) have consistent values with about 8% tin and 1% lead, which was common in the Iron Age (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.7b&lt;/strong&gt;). A Roman “bronze” strigil (TMA 1982.022) has no tin but more than 20% zinc, so it is actually brass (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.7a&lt;/strong&gt;). Retesting is planned to check if the zinc may be from a conservation treatment prior to its donation to the museum, but the lack of tin would make it unusual for first-century AD Roman finds. Each of the seven pieces of the chatelaine (TMA 1986.204a‒g), also assigned to about 100 AD, has a substantially different tin composition, and thus may be interpreted as a compilation of separately made items (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.7c–d&lt;/strong&gt;). All have high copper and tin, while one has especially high lead content (1986.204e). A “bronze” crossbow fibula (TMA 1993.004.010), assigned to the fourth century AD western Roman Empire at least needs much better labeling, as it includes zinc, gold, mercury, and silver, but no tin (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.8&lt;/strong&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orlando Museum has many metal objects labeled as “gold” but analyses by pXRF show that most are actually alloys, with high percentages of silver and copper as well (OMA 2003.078.1-2) (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.9a&lt;/strong&gt;). Many others are listed as tumbaga (Cu-Ag-Au alloy), but contain no gold or silver (&lt;strong&gt;table 36.2&lt;/strong&gt;). Starting in pre-Inca times, depletion gilding—involving acid treatment and oxidation of the surface—was used to make the immediate surface mostly gold, so XRF analyses result in varying concentrations depending on depth. Many other objects in the museum were simply labeled as “copper” or “metal”, with analyses revealing many that are arsenical copper (OMA 2004.104.1-4), &lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.9b&lt;/strong&gt;), and just a few that are bronze (with just 2–3% Sn) (OMA 2004.032) (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.9c&lt;/strong&gt;). One artifact, a knife (OMA 2004.074), has a high percentage of zinc, which was not used in Moche (pre-Columbian) times in the Americas, and thus is not authentic (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.9d&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;etruscan-bronze-mirrors-in-the-southeast-united-states&#34;&gt;Etruscan Bronze Mirrors in the Southeast United States&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shiny bronze mirrors were widely produced by the Etruscans, and many have been found in their tombs. Typically decorated on one side and smooth on the other, there are many now in American museums (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.10a–b&lt;/strong&gt;). Testing by pXRF has been used to assess the composition for Etruscan mirrors in American museums, as well as to further test the hypothesis that many may be fakes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Analyses have been done on more than thirty mirrors in the Smithsonian, Johns Hopkins University, the Walters Art Museum, the Baltimore Museum of Art, Emory University, the Tampa Museum of Art, and the Ringling Museum in Sarasota. Many are known to have been treated with a preservative, but analyzing multiple spots has allowed us to avoid that issue while addressing potential differences between the mirror sides and also with attached decorated handles (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 36.10c&lt;/strong&gt;). From the results obtained, it appears that in earlier Etruscan times, the amount of tin used was similar to that for bronze tools (~8–15%), while by the third century BC there was a big increase in the tin (~20–30%) and therefore the reflectiveness of the mirror. While many of the mirrors in these museums are thought to be fakes, based on their style, only a few have incompatible chemical compositions (with zinc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of nondestructive analytical techniques provides many opportunities for studying bronze and other objects in museums and other places around the world. The examples presented here illustrate some of the specific questions that knowledge of the composition of copper-based materials can answer. The user and readers of their reports, however, must realize that while the precision and accuracy of pXRF instrumental results are high, there remain limitations in the interpretation of the values taken from copper alloys with patinated and degraded surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the main criteria for selecting a coating for cultural heritage metal artifacts are (1) long-term insulation of their surfaces from contaminants due to environmental pollutants and handling; (2) the filtration of light through absorption of radiation; (3) considerable adhesion to the metal surface and elasticity; and finally (4) chemical stability. Ease of application and reversibility are also among the highly sought requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incralac® was introduced by INCRA (International Copper Research Association) in 1964 as a metal protective coating based on the acrylic resin Paraloid® B44 (an ethylacrylate –methylmethacrylate copolymer) with benzotriazole (BTA) as a main additive. It has been widely used in conservation as meeting the above requirements.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition to these compounds, small quantities of a stabilizer (i.e., crosslinker) such as epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), as well as hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) such as Tinuvin® 292 are occasionally added for conservation application.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Long-term for Incralac® coating typically means 5 to 8 years according to the manufacturers; however, museums rarely find the time to recoat their objects, and coatings are routinely used for longer periods of time than normally recommended by the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation practice studies have shown that the protection that Incralac® offers to outdoor bronze objects is only temporary, as various problems can arise with prolonged use, such as brittleness of the coating and irreversibility with solvents.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On the other hand, its indoor use appears to result in more enduring protection, as attested by many conservators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey in 2006&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; found that museums in Greece show a preference for Incralac® as a coating for ancient bronze objects in museums. Also, this coating has been routinely applied on both indoor and outdoor bronzes worldwide. As most conservators in Greece attest to its good performance as a long-term coating on ancient bronzes, this study was initiated to better understand the behavior of this coating for indoor bronze collections. Many studies have looked at the stability of this coating, with varying results.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One major study tested various coatings, such as Incralac® (with and without corrosion inhibitors) and BTA, on copper-alloyed panels with accelerated aging (indoor and outdoor conditions), and at outdoor test sites at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, the Swedish Corrosion Institute in Stockholm, and in Tirgu Jiu in Romania.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The study found Incralac® to be one of the best coatings in both outdoor tests and indoor accelerated-aging trials, but the prior application of a corrosion inhibitor such as BTA was found not to have any beneficial effect on the coating’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aims-of-the-work&#34;&gt;Aims of the Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work aims to better understand the condition of Incralac® coatings on bronze artifacts on display or in storage at the National Archaeological Museum and the Epigraphic and Numismatic Museum, both located in Athens, Greece, on the basis of year of application and treatment practice. Also, the research tried to correlate the results with artificial ageing of Incralac® on bronze coupons from different vendors in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;experimental-section-materials-and-specimens&#34;&gt;Experimental Section: Materials and Specimens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solvents:&lt;/em&gt; All solvents were Sigma-Aldrich, reagent grade: acetone, methyl-ethyl ketone, dichloromethane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coatings and Bronze Coupons:&lt;/em&gt; A number of Incralac® products were acquired especially for this research from typical distributors throughout Greece that sell conservation materials. For the sake of anonymity, these distributors are referred to below as A, B, C, D, and E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bronze coupons (63.81% Cu and 36.19% atom by SEM-EDX analysis) were prepared from larger bronze blocks and were cut into smaller specimens (2.0 x 2.0 x 0.03 cm). Accordingly, they were polished using SiC sandpapers successively with decreasing mesh diameter (P2400 and P4000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incralac® coatings were applied to the bronze coupons using a do-it-yourself spin coater at an average 1000 rpm (measured by a laser tachometer). This way, uniform films of 1.16–1.36 μm thickness were cast from their methyl-ethyl ketone (MEK) solutions (10% w/w) on each coupon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artificial Ageing Conditions:&lt;/em&gt; An artificial ageing protocol was employed involving heat, moisture, and UV-visible light to simulate average external conditions on a day-night succession basis. In particular, the following cycles were utilized: Low-mid humidity cycle (Cycle 1): 70°C, 60% RH, 7.5 days (UV-vis light was turned on and off every 22.5 min). High humidity cycle (Cycle 2): 70°C, 95% RH, 7.5 days (UV-vis light was turned on and off every 22.5 min).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytical Techniques:&lt;/em&gt; SEM-EDX analysis was done with a JEOL JSM-5310 system. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of Incralac® films were recorded (64 scans, 4 cm cm^–1^ resolution) using a PerkinElmer Spectrum GX I FTIR spectrometer as follows: (a) reflection-absorption spectra of artificially aged films on polished bronze were recorded using a PerkinElmer fixed angle (approx. 218) reflection accessory; the two mirrors allowed for manual angle optimization to achieve maximum energy throughput. The variability of film thickness in spin-coated bronze coupons was tested with recording FTIR spectra (64 acquisitions using a circular window of 2 mm diameter on the fixed angle accessory) of five different spots on each coupon and the absorbance areas at 1740–1720 cm^–1^ range were accordingly calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FTIR spectra of corrosion products from museum objects were recorded from detached powder samples, wherever possible, which were accordingly pressed into a KBr disc. Spectra of coatings from museum objects were recorded from their acetone (Merck, Pro-analysis) extracts, which were accordingly applied on clean KBr discs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;results-and-discussion-incralac-formulations-and-artificial-ageing&#34;&gt;Results and Discussion: Incralac® Formulations and Artificial Ageing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to investigate the actual formulations of the materials available in the market, as well as their behavior under simulated ageing conditions, before any further analysis is conducted on actual artifacts in order to ensure that results do not vary due to different formulations. Incralac® has been formulated as a coating containing acrylic resin (Paraloid® B44) as its base component and additives such as BTA or an aryl-substituted derivative. A few other materials are frequently added, such as ESO and Tinuvin® 292 (T). Chemical structures of involved materials are shown (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 37.1&lt;/strong&gt;); FTIR spectra of studied Incralac® formulations are shown in &lt;strong&gt;figure 37.2a&lt;/strong&gt;; FTIR peak assignments are given in &lt;strong&gt;table 37.2&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been previously suggested that Incralac® formulations, at least at the acrylic resin level may vary from supplier to supplier.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In our investigations, a number of Incralac® batches were analyzed with KBr-FTIR and results confirm this suggestion. Figure 37.2a shows the recorded spectra of Incralac® products acquired from various distributors in Greece (&lt;strong&gt;table 37.1&lt;/strong&gt;). It can be seen that the basic formulation is similar in most cases, with Paraloid® B44 being the base acrylic resin, with main absorptions at 2989, 2953, and 2846 cm^–1^ (antisymmetric stretching of CH~3~ and CH~2~ and symmetric stretching of CH~2~, correspondingly); 1732 cm^–1^ (ester carbonyl stretching); 1474, 1449, and 1387 cm^–1^ (CH~2~ and CH~3~ bending); and 1238, 1177, and 1147 (C-O-C stretching).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added quantities of BTA (possibly an aryl-substituted derivative as evidenced by the peaks at 1604, 1548, and 1494 cm^–1^) and of an epoxy-oil compound (possibly epoxidized soybean oil, based on distributors’ data sheets and the literature, and evidenced by the 2926 and 1265 cm^–1^ peaks) are also detected. (For FTIR peak assignments, see table 37.2.) In one specific case (distributor A), lower amounts of additives were detected through FTIR analysis than for the other distributors, while in another (distributor D), a different base polymer seems to have been used or added, possibly Paraloid® B48N (based on its 2961, 2876 C-H stretching absorption peaks pattern).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On this basis, it may be hypothesized that some manufacturers or distributors formulate their own Incralac-type products by employing primarily Paraloid® B44 (and in one case a different resin) and adding substituted BTA and/or epoxidized soybean oil (ESO); also, addition of other unspecified additive(s) in small quantities cannot be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance of various Incralac formulations was evaluated through artificial ageing of spin-coated films on polished bronze coupons, where accelerated ageing simulating day-night sequences was applied in two consecutive overall aging cycles (see Experimental Section for conditions). As seen in reflection FTIR spectra of their films (&lt;strong&gt;figs. 37.2b–c&lt;/strong&gt;), after artificial ageing Cycle 1 (see fig. 37.2b) all coupons showed dramatically lower BTA levels as compared to those of the initial materials (see fig. 37.2a), while after Cycle 2, BTA seems to have been completely removed (see fig. 37.2c). Sublimation of the material is a possible explanation as suggested in the literature and may lead to depletion of the anti-corrosion components in the formulation.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, the decrease and eventual disappearance of BTA in the coating over prolonged application times is possibly a more significant factor than the ageing of the resin material itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigating-the-condition-of-incralac-in-bronze-museum-objects&#34;&gt;Investigating the Condition of Incralac® in Bronze Museum Objects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objects from the National Archaeological Museum, Athens:&lt;/em&gt; Eight bronze objects from the collection of the National Archaeological Museum were selected on the basis of their previous conservation treatments with Incralac® formulations (see object photos in &lt;strong&gt;fig. 37.3&lt;/strong&gt;). In particular, the sample contained a jug (fig. 37.3a, Χ 7934, Greece, fifth century BC); a statuette complex with goddess Isis with Horus (fig. 37.3b, X 1974, Egypt, 26th–30th Dynasty, 600–300 BC); a mirror (fig. 37.3c, Χ 21039, unknown origin); a kyathos (fig. 37.3d, Χ 26175, Greece, end of 7th–beginning of 6th century BC); a ring (fig. 37.3e, Χ 25604, unknown origin); a spiral bracelet (fig. 37.3f, Χ 17166, Greece, possibly Geometric era); a strigil (fig. 37.3g, Χ 8297, Greece, fifth century BC); and a sword (fig. 37.3h, Π 7317, Greece, end of fifteenth–fourteenth century BC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FTIR spectra were recorded from acetone-extracted coating samples (see Experimental Section). As shown in &lt;strong&gt;figure 37.4&lt;/strong&gt;, no BTA could be detected in all cases in the coating, as no characteristic peaks of the component were present; this may be due either to decrease or removal of the additive in a manner similar to that of artificial ageing of coated bronze coupons (see above), or to the limited or ineffective extraction of this particular component through the selected solvent during sample collection. In addition, in some cases (objects X 1974, X 21039, and X 8297) the condition of coatings was found to be only slightly changed or totally unchanged compared to the initial condition of the base acrylic resin. However, in other cases (objects Χ 26175, Χ 17166, and Χ 25604), significant formation of hydroxyl absorptions (broad features at 3500–3200 cm^–1^) indicate oxidation and/or hydrolytic degradation of esters. The latter can be ruled out, as absorption of polyacrylate copper salts at the 1600–1550 cm^–1^ range&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is not evident. The newly formed band at ca. 1646 cm^–1^, which was particularly intense in the case of object Χ 17166 (conserved in 1998–99 using Incralac® material from distributor E), was assigned to C=C absorptions due to oxidation-induced unsaturation in the acrylic resin backbone; additionally, the dark reddish appearance of this object’s coated surface (see fig. 37.3f) supports this assignment. Relatively high degradation levels were also detected in objects Χ 25604 and X 25175, which were attributed to the same factors. In accordance with the conservation records, it can be assumed that the poor coating performance resulted from the failure to stabilize the object with corrosion inhibitor BTA, rather than being an effect of the coating itself, as material from the same distributor performed better in other cases. This assumption contradicts another study,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but that study was on test panels and not on real archaeological bronzes as in our case. Stabilization of bronzes using corrosion inhibitor BTA is routinely carried out in Greece prior to Incralac® application, and the combined use of BTA and Incralac® is highly recommended by conservators in Greece for its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objects from the Epigraphic and Numismatic Museum, Athens:&lt;/em&gt; Selected coins originating from several archaeological periods and categorized according to their conservation treatments (between 1982 and 2002) were investigated (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 37.5; tables 37.3–4&lt;/strong&gt;). They were categorized as follows: Byzantine (group A, conserved 2002), Greek Imperial (group B, conserved 1997), Hellenistic (group C, conserved 1992), Ancient Greek and Greek Imperial (group D, conserved 1987), and Late Roman and Byzantine coins (group E, conserved 1982). It was not possible in every case to detach powdered samples from the coin surface for analysis. Therefore, the analysis was only based on FTIR spectra of the extracted coating using the method described in the Experimental Section. In all cases, little or no BTA was detected, while minor amounts of ESO were found through the epoxy-ring absorption at 1265–1270 cm^–1^ absorption (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 37.6&lt;/strong&gt;). Moreover, in this case too, evidence for oxidative degradation of the coating materials was evidenced through the 1642 cm^–1^ absorption due to oxidation-induced unsaturation, i.e., formation of C=C; this was found to be more intense in the case of Hellenistic coins (group C) conserved during 1992 using Incralac® acquired from distributor E. From the data in table 37.4, it can be inferred that the poor performance of the coating can be attributed to lack of stabilization of coin surfaces (with BTA) after chemical cleaning as well as possible surface morphology issues such as pitting and cracks in the specific object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrutiny of the conservation records, visual inspection, SEM-EDX analysis, and FTIR analysis of the studied objects resulted in a comprehensive assessment of the condition of the objects’ surfaces, including their coatings. The results from the National Archaeological Museum are listed in table 37.3, while those of the Epigraphic and Numismatic Museum are in table 37.4. It can be seen that in specific cases from both museums, a combination of factors—the product purchased from distributor E, the application method in combination with the treatment practice (i.e., mechanical treatment and stabilization of bronze surface or chemical treatment), and the preservation state of the objects—resulted in poor coating condition. FTIR spectra of extracted coating material in these cases showed oxidative degradation, which resulted in deeply yellowed coating (as evidenced by visual inspection). The fact that in other cases the product from the same distributor (E) performed better, leads to the conclusion that pre-treatment of bronze surface by immersing the object in BTA solution helped to form a thin protective film of a copper-BTA complex, which improved the coating’s performance.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, it is not been shown whether the absence of BTA in the investigated solvent-extracted coatings is responsible for the overall coating performance at any level. At this point, reflection-absorption FTIR spectroscopy performed in situ and non-destructively on the artifacts’ surfaces could yield a more conclusive assessment; in this study, however, this was not possible. The decision to coat or not to coat museum bronze artifacts is left to the conservator, who must decide the best protocol based on the conditions of the museum environment and handling of the objects. Our study tried to highlight that coating changes may occur long-term and may not yet be visible to the naked eye. Since the conclusion of this study, the conservators of the National Epigraphic and Numismatic Museum have decided to discontinue use of any coatings on their coin collection. Conservators from the National Archaeological Museum still use Incralac® coatings on their bronzes, and attest to its good performance relative to other types of coatings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient bronzes often contain surface decoration in the corrosion layers or show evidence of tinning, niello, gilding, paint, or organic materials in the corrosion layers. Depending on the quantity of chlorides in their surfaces, traditional conservation methods to stabilize bronze disease are either (1) locally to treat the artifact with Ag~2~O particles or zinc dust; followed by complete immersion in sodium sesquicarbonate (pH 10) solutions with or without electrolysis to convert cupreous chloride to more stable corrosion product(s);&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and/or (2) the use of corrosion inhibitors, such as benzotriazole.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Our goal was to develop alternative conservation methods to treat such objects in order to preserve information by minimizing the overall changes that may occur to the patina surfaces with such treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper presents a novel treatment approach for a thirteenth-century Byzantine copper frying pan that was excavated from a shipwreck off of Rhodes and retains what appears to be intentional tinning on its surface. The paper examines the black surface to determine its nature and the condition of the artifact. It further discusses the treatment of the object with the aim of preserving this black layer, which serves as an archaeological record providing evidence of its use in food preparation. Traditional chloride removal methods for marine copper-alloy artifacts may result in unwanted removal of these types of compounds/corrosion products. Our treatment involved the application of local electrolysis with 1% (w/v) of sodium sesquicarbonate solution on areas with no evidence of tinning, and the application of L-cysteine as a nontoxic corrosion inhibitor to help preserve the artifact over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;local-electrolysis-and-l-cysteine-as-a-corrosion-inhibitor-for-ancient-copper-alloys&#34;&gt;Local Electrolysis and L-Cysteine as a Corrosion Inhibitor for Ancient Copper Alloys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metals Conservation Lab (TEI-A) in Egaleo, Greece, carried out research from 2006 to 2015 in collaboration with the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) and Arc’Antique of Nantes, France, to develop the methods of local electrolysis of metals to either extract chlorides or reduce corrosion products back to their metal state during treatments. This approach offers better control for the conservator than the traditional methods that use complete immersion of marine artifacts in electrolytes involving either chemical or electrochemical methods. In 2008, TEI-A was commissioned to treat an eight-ton iron paddle wheel recovered from the 1868 shipwreck &lt;em&gt;Patris&lt;/em&gt; in the Aegean Sea. To extract chlorides, conservators used a cost-effective method that has been traditionally used by industry to stabilize reinforced concrete. The scientific results both in the laboratory and in the field on the paddle wheel (in a dry state) indicated that the technique is capable of removing the majority of the chlorides with two applications of impressed current (applied as local electrolysis) for 24 hours each time.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The method was also applied to remove chlorides locally from a wet marine copper-alloy composite artifact with textile remaining on the surface, applying 1% (w/v) sodium sesquicarbonate solutions to selected areas.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Using this localized approach, areas on the artifacts with organic remains could be avoided and thus preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L-cysteine has already been investigated in metals conservation as a replacement for benzotriazole (BTA) applied to corroded bronze coupons (with nantokite formation) by immersion in water at 0.15M for 24 hours;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by immersion in ethanol at 0.01M for 24 hours;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Abu-Baker-et-al-2013&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:Abu-Baker-et-al-2013&#34;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and during PEG400 treatments for a marine copper-alloy composite artifact with organic remains.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Zacharopoulou-et-al-2016&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:Zacharopoulou-et-al-2016&#34;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Argyropoulos, Boyatzis, et al. forthcoming) Gravgaarda and van Lanschot (2012) also carried out tests on real bronze artifacts in comparing cysteine to BTA. All these studies found color changes to the corrosion layers (graying effect) with the cysteine application, which darkens to a black color with longer immersion exposures. With their electrochemical measurements, Abu-Baker et al. (2013) found that, with increasing amounts of tin in the bronze alloy, the strength of the inhibitor’s chemisorption on the surface of the alloy, or its corrosion inhibition efficiency, increases. Further research found that immersion in cysteine for copper alloys results in producing cystine from the oxidation of cysteine, where the presence of iron or copper ions serves as a catalyst in this reaction. This oxidation reaction results in reducing metal ions, which form a metal ion cystine complex on the surface of the material, and producing either a soluble or insoluble cysteine/cysteinate complex with metal ions and cystine precipitate respectively in the solutions.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The graying effect is most likely a result of the metal ion cystine complex on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-investigation-of-a-marine-medieval-frying-pan&#34;&gt;Scientific Investigation of a Marine Medieval Frying Pan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frying pan was exposed to an open sea environment as well as buried in the marine sediment for centuries. As a result, there has been substantial loss of metal with cracks and deformation to its shape. The pan was made from a copper sheet of approximately 98 wt.% copper and 1 wt.% tin (analyzed by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDAX); see below), which was hammered into shape with a base diameter of around 19 to 21 cm as shown in &lt;strong&gt;figure 38.1&lt;/strong&gt;. A riveted 10.5 cm handle also made of copper sheet metal was folded and hammered into a tube shape. Given the poor condition of the object, it is difficult to assess whether the sides of the pan were straight or angled; they have a preserved maximum height of 3.7 cm. The interior of the object is covered with a black surface (see fig. 38.1), which is assumed to be evidence of intentional tinning. Copper cooking wares were always intentionally tinned, usually with a hot-tinning process in their interior, to prevent the copper from contaminating food during cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corrosion samples were analyzed nondestructively from five different locations with a two-step process: first, SEM-EDAX to identify the micro-morphology of the compounds/corrosion products on the surface as well as their elemental concentrations; second, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to identify their mineralogical composition. SEM-EDAX type GEAN GSM 6510 low vacuum with X-ART detector (working distance: 20 mm) was used. Also, XRD analysis was carried out using the Olympus BTXII Benchtop XRD/XRF (Co source) with software (XPowder) for processing the resulting XRD data (XRD range 5–55^o^ 2Ø), including the AMSCD mineral database. The sample for XRD analysis needs to be around 15 mg and running times from 20 to 60 minutes depending on the type of sample. Also, a very small piece from the base of the pan containing metal and corrosion, which was separated from the main object due to burial conditions, was examined using a stereomicroscope with digital camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figures 38.2&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;38.3&lt;/strong&gt; show the microscopic images of this cross-section of the copper metal with the black surface as well as other types of corrosion products. In both images, there appears to be a thin tin metal or intermetallic compound covering the copper metal. Manti and Watkinson (2011) concluded that such black surfaces are the result of intentional tinning rather than surface corrosion of low-tin archaeological bronzes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black corrosion products from another area of the interior surface were further analyzed using SEM-EDAX and XRD. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 38.4&lt;/strong&gt; shows the micromorphology of the corrosion products, with small round globules indicating the possibility of intermetallic compound η-Cu~6~Sn~5~ with around a 57 wt.% tin concentration, suggesting a hot-tinning process. However, XRD was unable to confirm this compound due to the small sample size and the complexity of the diffraction pattern due to the fact that it was difficult to isolate this compound from other mineral species present in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XRD analyses of corrosion taken from five different areas on the object found copper oxides, chlorides, carbonates, and sulphides: tenorite, cuprite, clinoatacamite, paratacamite, malachite, chalcocite, covellite, and digenite. The presence of copper sulfides indicates that the object was buried under marine sand, with the eventual result that the main cathodic reaction was hydrogen evolution stimulated by sulfate-reducing bacteria.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; An adherent protective film of copper sulfides resulted on the surface. The large holes in the surface of the frying pan indicate that pitting corrosion was prevalent due to the presence of cuprous chlorides (nantokite), although its presence was not confirmed by XRD analysis. Nantokite is found next to the metal, and sampling may not have reached the area containing this corrosion product, since it is always present in wet marine copper alloys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;treatment-approach&#34;&gt;Treatment Approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathodic polarization was carried out at a constant potential of –0.76 V vs. SSE using an EG&amp;amp;G Verstat II potentiostat (applied as local electrolysis) for 3 hours each time before changing the electrolyte (1% w/v sodium sesquicarbonate solutions) in the sponge to remove chlorides locally from the frying pan on selected areas (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 38.5&lt;/strong&gt;). The areas treated were the base of the pan and its handle, which did not show any evidence of tinning (black surface). In this way, areas on the artifact with tinned surface could be avoided by the procedure and thus preserved. The artifact was maintained wet during treatment with deionized water. Cathodic polarization was applied to the handle a total of seven times (for 3 hours each time) until a minimum quantity of chlorides was found in the electrolyte solution, each time changing the sponge and using fresh electrolyte solution. However, for the base of the pan the procedure was repeated 3 times for 3 hours each time. The number of applications also depended on the visual changes to the patina after each application of local electrolysis. After the end of the treatment procedure, the object was thoroughly rinsed with deionized water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each application, the electrolytic solution used was collected to check the amount of chlorides extracted during the electrolysis, using the HANNA chloride electrode and Mohr’s method for chloride determination. The quantities of chlorides removed after each 3-hour application of cathodic polarization were plotted vs. time, and are shown in &lt;strong&gt;figures 38.6&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;38.7&lt;/strong&gt; for the handle and base, respectively. The results show that the technique removed around 7 and 8 g of chlorides from each surface, respectively. The electrolytic treatment could have continued, since the slope of each plot continued to increase, but it was decided to stop the treatment and use L-cysteine instead so as to minimize surface patina changes. After the electrolysis, any calcium carbonate concretions from the object’s surface were removed using dental tools, and finally cysteine as a corrosion inhibitor was applied to ensure the object would be stable after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cysteine was tested on another fragment of a tinned copper-alloy artifact from the same marine site. The piece was immersed in 1% (w/v) solution of cysteine in deionized water for 3 hours as opposed to 24 hours as tested by the other studies. After slight rinsing with a soft brush, it was placed in a climatic chamber for 24 hours at 70% RH with an untreated fragment from the same artifact, for comparative purposes. The cysteine-treated piece was found to be stable while the other had signs of active corrosion. For the frying pan, it was decided to apply the cysteine with a paintbrush every 2 hours over 3 days. Again after light rinsing with a soft brush, it was left to dry in a polystyrene box on top of polyethylene foam, with silica gel to help dry it gradually. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 38.8&lt;/strong&gt; shows the base of the frying pan before (a) and after (b) treatment, and indicates that, apart from a slight graying effect, both electrolysis and the application of L-cysteine maintained the patina appearance. One year after treatment, the frying pan remains stable in storage with no signs of active corrosion. The conservation work for the object still needs to be completed by deciding whether a coating will be used as well as the best method for restoring it for future display in a museum in Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper presented a case study in which local electrolysis and the use of L-cysteine, an alternative corrosion inhibitor to BTA, can successfully be applied to stabilize a marine copper-alloy artifact with evidence of a tinned surface. Such a treatment approach can be applied to marine copper-alloy artifacts when the aim is to preserve information in the patina of such objects, which may traditionally be sacrificed during conservation treatment in order to stabilize the artifact. The treatment approach was successful at stabilizing a thirteenth-century marine copper-alloy frying pan with evidence of tinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-the-artifact&#34;&gt;History of the Artifact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equine bronze protome known as the Medici Riccardi horse head in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale of Florence is likely a surviving part of a Hellenistic life-size equestrian sculptural group, which has been dated around the second half of the fourth century BC.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The sculpture entered the antiquarian collections of the Medici in the fifteenth century and was cited for the first time in 1495 as part of Lorenzo il Magnifico’s antiquarian collection,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; although it had certainly been found well before that. Its close resemblance to the colossal Carafa horse head in Naples, executed by Donatello between 1456 and 1458 in imitation of this original, provides an indirect &lt;em&gt;terminus ante quem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head is also cited in the Confiscation Decree by the Republican Government as being among the artifacts of the garden of the Palazzo Medici. Between 1495 and 1512 it was in Palazzo Vecchio (perhaps in the Cortile della Dogana); then it returned to the aforementioned garden,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where it was admired by Lorenzo Bernini in 1665.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1672 the artwork was restored and adapted as a fountain mouth by Bartolomeo Cennini.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being moved to Palermo in 1800 in order to avoid confiscation by Napoleon,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the head returned to Florence in 1815, when it was displayed the Galleria degli Uffizi.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Finally, in 1890, it was transferred to the Regio Museo Archeologico, now the Museo Archeologico Nazionale of Florence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-of-conservation&#34;&gt;State of Conservation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the recent cleaning treatments, the sculpture appeared rather dark and many of its details were obscured by a complex superposition of random materials (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 39.1&lt;/strong&gt;). A sequence of irregular material levels was recognized within the stratification using portable Raman spectroscopy. Beeswax and oily substances applied in maintenance treatments; residues of calcareous growths (due to the use of the sculpture as a fountain mouth); and underlying corrosion layers (Cu-carbonates on tenorite and cuprite) were identified along with some residues from molding operations made using gypsum or silicone rubber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widespread calcareous growths were present on both the outer and inner surfaces. On the inside, these growths descended behind the eyes and the forehead just below the tuft (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 39.2a&lt;/strong&gt;), which likely hosted the fountain pipe. Accumulations on the outer surface were mainly concentrated on the frontal part and skinfolds (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 39.2b&lt;/strong&gt;), while a smaller amount was present on the neck. However, before the sculpture entered museum collections, the outer calcareous encrustations were probably roughly removed using mechanical tools and just a small amount of residue was left flattened on the metal surface. Tool marks and deep scratches associated with this cleaning are evident, along with marks of sharp blades, rhomboidal tips of darts, or arrows—concentrated on the head but also present elsewhere (see for example fig. 39.2b)—which can be linked to the ancient vicissitudes of the artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In various areas, traces of gilding were found. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDX) of some minute fragments of this gilding (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 39.3&lt;/strong&gt;) allowed assessment. Results showed it to be a very thin (not more than a few microns), irregular gold film, which was well adhered to the underlying corrosion products (see fig. 39.3a). No traces of glue or mercury amalgam were found (the gold is pure). This, along with the imprint of the inner side of the gold leaf produced by the texture of the bronze surface (see fig. 39.3b), suggests it was likely applied using heat and mechanical means. The residual leaf fragments are very fragile and required special attention during the cleaning operations in order to safeguard this important evidence of decoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conservation-intervention&#34;&gt;Conservation Intervention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent restoration was mainly aimed at removing aggressive exogenous substances and recovering the complete legibility of the object. The intervention was carried out in a dedicated room of the archaeological museum between January and March 2015. Visitors had the opportunity to see most of the intervention, though the use of dangerous substances and noisy tools was restricted to closed periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After preliminary material removal tests, which were carried out in order to optimize the treatment, the following operational sequence was performed on the outer surface, leaving the interior untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removal of powder and of the outer layer of the aged protective organic materials by washing the surface using cotton pads soaked in a solvent blend of petroleum ether (80–120°C) and methyl ethyl ketone (75/25 volume ratio).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application of agar gel supporting an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate with pH8. The application time was 4–7 minutes, which was sufficient for softening and saponification of the oleo-waxy superposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removal of the agar gel and softened materials using soaked pads as in 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repetition of the washing treatment reinforced with a blend of cyclohexane and butyl acetate using a volume fraction of 55/45, respectively. This made it possible to safely expose the oxidized bronze surface and residual calcareous spots by safeguarding the traces of gilding (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 37.4&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposed calcareous spots were removed using a piezoelectric ablator and sharp tools such as metal tips, wooden sticks, and porcupine spines. The surface was then homogenized using plastic-bristle brushes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection with microcrystalline wax (1% in petroleum ether at 140–180°C), which is reversible and easily replicable, and finishing using natural-bristle brushes and cotton fabric. The general views of fig. 39.1b–c and the details of &lt;strong&gt;figs. 39.5–6&lt;/strong&gt; show the significant improvement of legibility achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some areas, minor watercolor retouches were also needed in order to smooth the abrupt chromatic variation (in the area of the phalerae) or to veil calcareous residues trapped within the surface roughness. In a few cases, suitably pigmented microcrystalline wax was also used to fill microcraters and other irregularities of the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small rectangular area on the collar of the horse (left side), which includes the old inventory number (1639), was intentionally left untouched as a witness to the previous appearance of the protome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present restoration also provided the opportunity to create a new mechanical support and to recover a more natural anatomical posture for the protome relative to its previous display. The structure was designed using 3D simulations and crafted using steel. This support was intended as a temporary solution for the exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World&lt;/em&gt;, allowing for a better view of the object and easy movability. However, the new support is also suitable for installation on the previous eighteenth-century pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-on-the-sculptural-subject&#34;&gt;Notes on the Sculptural Subject&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment described above recovered some of the original expressive strength of the Medici Riccardi horse head, with its pronounced realism and minimal use of stylization. Such a precise naturalism is not observed in other ancient bronze horses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, despite the many studies of ancient horses, the surviving part of the original artwork does not allow us to determine the equine race of the horse or even whether it was pulling a chariot or mounted by a rider. We can only say that the horse was well proportioned, since the length of its head (65 cm from the forehead to the muzzle) relative to the neck (80.5 cm from the poll to the withers) is quite realistic. The right side of the protome shows the powerful, tense muscular structure of the neck terminating at the poll with a realistic muscle bulge, which makes more evident the link between the buzz-cut mane, the combed tuft, and the ears. The latter with their dense internal hairs are well proportioned and oriented in opposite directions: the right ear is directed forward at full attention, while the left is turned and tilted to back, which suggests that the original sculptural was highly dynamic. Apart from the latter peculiar detail, the expressive tension of the subject and its formal solution recall the two small prancing horses of Herculaneum found in the area of the theater during the Bourbon excavations of the second half of the eighteenth century.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structural equilibrium of the forehead, temples, and eyebrow arch was certainly useful in accentuating the eyes (which were likely made using nonmetallic materials) and the direction of the gaze, while the relatively thin nose—with nostril dilated by impetuous breath—reinforces the notion that the object was conceived as part of a very dynamic ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open mouth and the retracted tongue allows us to see the short teeth, which are typical of a young horse at the height of its strength. The energy that the animal holds back is also evidenced by the veins bulging all over the muzzle and the tense head. The head and neck are turning to left, where there are more skin folds on the throat and lips than on the corresponding right side. Thus the reins could have been stretched from the left side at the height of the withers or around the middle zone of the neck, which corresponds to the typical position of a rider’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-examination&#34;&gt;Technical Examination&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various surface textures and chromatic features provide at first glance evidence of two different periods of the artwork’s life. Greenish mineralizations are observable all over the head and the upper part of the neck (those of the left side appear relatively irregular, due to interment conditions and previous invasive cleaning treatments), which shade toward the lower part of the neck; there, the modern integrations resulted in changes of color from red to brown to black. A number of losses were repaired with modern additions, including a large missing area at the left side, the entire collar (including its front banderole), which is partially superimposed on the ancient metal, and the upper part of the right ear. Furthermore, integrations are recognizable on the muzzle in the form of three recastings. Both ears were cropped in the past, and only the right one arrived to us restored, whereas the left only includes an internal uncorrelated repair. A number of intentional cuts, along with the extensive damage to the left side and the evident marks of weapons, indicate that the original sculpture likely was vandalized by being beheaded near the typical neck joint of bronze horses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned integrations were executed mainly by means of recasting, which involved significant heating of the original part and then the formation of a significant amount of cuprite and tenorite redox reactions. Similarly, the subsequent cold smoothing of the patches and collar were extended to the adjacent original parts. However, the final result of this restoration remains technically rather far from the richness of detail and quality of the original, including precise casting and fine chasing of the whole surface. The ancient bronze smiths lavished particular attention on the finishing of the mouth, the skinfolds, and the hair of the tuft and mane, which also include dense punch work between the two levels of locks achieved using a triangular punch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repairs, as well as the two functional holes in proximity of the withers (see the dark spots in fig. 39.1), which were likely needed to adapt the sculpture as a fountain, have to be attributed to the restoration by Bartolomeo Cennini in 1672.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crownpiece, eyes, upper terminal of the tuft, and reins are missing. The former likely included nine phalerae whose position is evident from the set of large plugs and surface abrasions corresponding to the holes where the ancient anchoring elements of the phalerae were secured. There is also evidence of soft soldering along a linear stretch of the left cheek.
&amp;ldquo;
All the relevant technical features were precisely mapped on the 3D model of the outer surface, which was achieved using a range camera (Artec Eva) and suitable software. As shown in &lt;strong&gt;fig. 39.7&lt;/strong&gt;, the contours of the modern integrations of the protome, including a number of plugs, were recognized. Most of them are randomly distributed, whereas the nine associated with the phalerae are arranged regularly along the missing metal strips of the crownpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tongue was likely executed by means of a casting-on operation, as suggested by its close proximity to the surrounding part of the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the areas of the modern integrations of the neck, the inner surface of the protome is relatively smooth, roughly reproducing the exterior, and does not exhibit any traces of wax joins. Minor reliefs, such as those of the locks of the mane, present corresponding modulations of the inner surface (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 39.8&lt;/strong&gt;). This suggests that the wax model was formed using liquid wax. However, the lack of satisfactory radiographic data (only a few unclear images are available from the investigation of the 1990s&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), the apparently strange imprint observed at the inner surface of the mane where its shape is rather sharp, and other features led us to a detailed interpretation of the preparation procedure of the wax model for casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both interior and exterior surfaces were scanned and digitally reconstructed. These two 3D models were merged by exploiting the visible cross-section of the neck, thus achieving a complete volume model of the bronze wall that allowed examination of its thickness. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 39.9&lt;/strong&gt; summarizes some meaningful cross sections, such as those of the front (fig. 39.9b), the neck (fig. 39.9c), and the mane (fig. 39.9d–e). The front shows moderate thickness variations and then a good correspondence between the outer and inner profiles of the right side and mane (original parts), while more pronounced thickness variations are observed in the mane. However, the mane also shows the congruence between reliefs and indentations, although the thickness variations observed are significant; note for example that in fig. 39.9e, the left side is much thicker than the right at the upper zone. This observation, along with the sharp crest of the mane at the inner surface (fig. 39.9b), led us to consider the possibility of significant direct modeling work. However, the aforementioned features depend on many material parameters, such as possible thinning during the finishing of the wax model; the possible differences in terms of mineralization and encrustation of the two inner sides of the mane; the type of wax; and the casting process. After a critical evaluation of the data collected, we conclude that the present protome was executed according to the typical copy process wherein the wax replica was made by slush casting and direct finishing.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The detail reported in fig. 39.8, showing the very smooth internal undulation of the right side of the head and the thickness profiles of figs. 39.9b–c, seem convincing evidence of slush casting. Probably the cleaning of the internal surface or a detailed radiographic examination would also bring to light the drips that were expected but not observed in the present study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of completeness, let us also observe that the radiographic images collected during the investigation of the 1990s&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; show a very straight wax join in proximity to the terminal part of the muzzle. Assuming this is not an accidental effect, it could be interpreted as a consequence of an intentional cut into the wax needed in order to build and dry the core structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alloy compositions were thoroughly investigated using laser induced plasma (or breakdown) spectroscopy (LIPS or LIBS). In this noninvasive technique, short laser pulses are focused on the material of interest and its elemental weight fractions are derived through the spectral analysis of the bright plasma plumes generated at the laser focus.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In some details a compositional depth profile is collected along typical depths of several hundred microns; then the bulk composition is derived by averaging the concentrations of the deeper part of this profile. (This innovative approach has also been exploited to study the Chimaera of Arezzo.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) The measurement points are mapped in fig. 39.7 (white numbers and dots), and the corresponding results are listed in &lt;strong&gt;table 39.1&lt;/strong&gt;. Two distinct type of bronze alloys were measured using LIPS, with the following average compositions: (1) tin 11 wt%, lead 1.0 wt%, trace of iron for the main casting (most of the protome); (2) tin 4.3 wt%, lead 2.4 wt%, nickel 1.5 wt%, traces of zinc and iron for repairs already preliminarily attributed to the Cennini restoration, including the integration of the left side (main recasting), the collar, and the plugs closing the anchoring holes of the phalerae (measured sites: 14, 19, and 27). By contrast, the plugs corresponding to sites 24 and 25 have an alloy similar to the main one and are hence interpretable as ancient repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coherence of the modern integration and plugs is very strong: besides having a similar amount of tin and lead, the relatively high nickel content and the frequent traces of zinc are very significant. These data are in substantial agreement with those reported by De Marinis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[A-head]Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present conservation treatments carried out on the Medici Riccardi horse head recovered the realism and dynamism of the original part of the sculpture and allowed to us to uncover and safeguard minute traces of gilding all over the artwork. These elements were previously obscured by waxy patinations, calcareous growths, and deposits. The formal features and the details of the protome are now more legible, while the modern repairs have been made more evident than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gilding traces uncovered are much greater than expected. The widespread presence of gold-leaf microfragments among the skinfolds, on the throat, mane, and tongue, in the ears, and elsewhere, along with the lack of a mordant, prove that the head was gilded in ancient times. The former presence of a crownpiece with phalerae is also evident. Thus, we believe the reconstruction of &lt;strong&gt;fig. 39.10&lt;/strong&gt; is reliably supported by the present data. Most of the gold leaf was lost due to the burial conditions, the use of the sculpture as a fountain, and the aggressive mechanical and chemical cleaning treatments, which eroded the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The archaeometallurgical study also allowed us to identify all the additions introduced during the seventeenth-century restoration by Bartolomeo Cennini. The data show the main alloy is very close to the conventional 90–10 (here Sn 11 wt% and Pb 1 wt%) traditionally used for large bronzes from the Classical period and up to the Roman Republican period. Examination of the metal wall thicknesses through the virtual sectioning of the double surface-3D model provided important evidence about the wax model for casting and definitively demonstrated indirect casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-and-pre-accession-investigation&#34;&gt;Introduction and Pre-accession Investigation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only life-size bronze version of the sculptural type traditionally known as &lt;em&gt;Apollo Sauroktonos&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Apollo the Lizard-Slayer&lt;/em&gt;), now re-named &lt;em&gt;Apollo the Python-Slayer&lt;/em&gt; and attributed to Praxiteles, is part of the permanent collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art (inv. 2004.30; &lt;strong&gt;fig. 40.1a–d&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There are approximately twenty other known sculptures of this type that exist, all in marble with one reduced-scale bronze copy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland bronze was carefully studied before its acquisition in 2004, and initial visual examinations noted the inlaid copper lips and nipples, the inlaid stone eyes (the right is original), and the separately cast and welded-on front half of the right foot. Numerous rectangular patches and square chaplet holes were noted as evidence of original manufacture. The head had been joined to the neck and the lower left leg joined to the calf in a recent restoration, as evidenced by the use of modern adhesives and a modern internal armature. Most surfaces had been mechanically cleaned except for areas of the hair that retained layers of corrosion and dirt. A dent on the right leg exhibited fracturing and appeared to be something that had occurred post-excavation. Clumps of metal on the back and legs seemed to be related, at least in part, to the tree, now missing. The openings at the arms and feet revealed wax manipulation marks in locations not obscured by modern resin repairs, indicating that the sculpture had been created by the indirect casting process. The bronze plate serving as a base appeared to have been added, as it could never have supported the sculpture on its own, but it was sufficiently corroded to have been in place for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radiographs clarified areas of modern repair, such as plaster and resin fills around the neck and shoulders, demonstrating that the figure was nearly complete. Also noted were the thick walls (about half a centimeter in many locations) and large individually cast sections of bronze. The radiographs taken at that time did not appear to show that the head was joined at the jawline, and, despite much damage to the neck, written reports concluded that the head was likely cast to the mid-neck (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 40.2&lt;/strong&gt;). This visual analysis and radiography provided important basic information about the figure, yet many questions about *Apollo*’s original manufacture, subsequent excavation, and display remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, two of the authors, Peter Northover and Ernst Pernicka, were invited to collaborate. This earlier phase of research is summarized briefly here so that the focus of the paper can remain on the most recent analysis. Three samples of bronze were selected from the detached hand, the right shoulder, and the base. Northover analyzed the samples by electron probe microanalysis with wavelength dispersive spectrometry, and afterward the samples were also examined metallographically in both polished and etched states. It was concluded that the hand and shoulder belonged to the same object and were thoroughly corroded, with almost all the lead having been replaced by corrosion products. In contrast the base was found to be barely corroded at all. What corrosion was present on the base was natural but different in character, suggesting that the base dated from a more recent remounting; based on the known history of the artifact, a date between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century is suggested (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 40.3&lt;/strong&gt;). In addition, the corrosion products excluded the possibility that the sculpture had been buried in a marine environment. The lizard (now identified as a “python”) was subsequently sampled in 2006, taking pieces from the front proper left leg and rear proper left leg, to compare either side of the central join.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compositional analysis of the five samples showed the torso and python belonged together, but the base had a different history. The corrosion products on the figure were consistent with an object that was buried for an extended time and then re-exposed to atmospheric corrosion and precipitation. Interestingly, analysis indicated that early in its history the figure was exposed to extreme heat, while the base did not show evidence of having been in a fire. The two halves of the python seemed to have been cast from the same melt, with some differences in composition due to segregation of lead. The alloy was found to be a low- to medium-tin bronze with 6.7–7.6% tin and 8.6–16.3% lead and was related to the main figure, which had similar tin and lead contents. At that time, it was not possible to determine whether the hand was related, with only one extensively corroded sample having been examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pernicka tested four samples of lead solder in order to determine how the baseplate might relate to the figure: three from the proper right foot that was separately cast and one sample from the body of the figure. They were analyzed by energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), and the sample from the figure was additionally analyzed by neutron activation analysis, essentially confirming the electron microprobe analyses. Two solder samples were tested for a radioactive signal of ^210^Pb (see below for test description.). One sample did not yield a usable result and was inconclusive. Another showed measurable radioactivity, which would indicate that the lead and tin were produced within the last hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recent-testing-bronze-compositional-analyses&#34;&gt;Recent Testing: Bronze Compositional Analyses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 a Cleveland Museum of Art focus exhibition on &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt; provided an opportunity to continue analysis of the sculpture, and Northover and Pernicka traveled to Cleveland for study and sampling. Additional cross-sections were taken from numerous areas of the figure, the detached forearm and hand, and the python. Seventeen samples in all were carefully selected for location and accessibility, with the goal of obtaining as much information from as few samples as possible, and these were mechanically removed from the bronze. As many as 11 areas on every sample (30 x 50 µm) were analyzed with wavelength dispersive spectrometry and electron probe microanalysis, and 16 elements were recorded as individual compositions of each sample in weight percent. Electron probe microanalysis of the samples verified that the figure was composed of a high-lead, low-tin bronze, as found in earlier analyses (see &lt;strong&gt;table 40.1&lt;/strong&gt; for percentages).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; After analysis the mounted samples were studied in both polished and etched states. The results of the metallographic analysis are consistent with the figure, hand, and python being ancient, as they all have thick corrosion crusts and deep penetration that developed during burial and subsequent outdoor exposure. In fact, some samples were too corroded to be etched and could only be examined as polished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ascertain whether parts of the figure derived from the same casting or the same raw metal source, multiple small samples from locations throughout the figure were obtained with a steel drill bit to be analyzed with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and EDXRF. This combination of analyses confirmed that the bronze samples had a uniform composition with the exception of the baseplate, which had more lead and less tin than the rest of the figure.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The uniformity of the figure, the left hand, the forearm, and the python was further confirmed by lead-isotope ratios, with only the lead solder on the baseplate having a clearly different lead isotope signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evidence-of-a-fire&#34;&gt;Evidence of a Fire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, parts of the figure’s body, especially the right arm and shoulder, appear at some point in their history to have been exposed to a high-temperature oxidizing atmosphere, such as in a fire. The evidence for this is a band of cuprite particles beneath the metal surface, which was formed by the inward diffusion of oxygen at high temperature (internal oxidation) (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 40.4a–b&lt;/strong&gt;). Another sign of exposure to a high temperature environment is the lump on the back of the left thigh (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 40.5&lt;/strong&gt;). While previously believed to be fractured supports for the missing tree, these amorphous bits of metal attached to the figure are now known to have solidified from an oxygen-rich melt, as demonstrated by the presence of cassiterite crystals in cross sections.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-of-the-baseplate&#34;&gt;Analysis of the Baseplate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irregularly cut bronze plate now serving as a base required additional research, as most ancient bronze statue bases are made of stone. Moreover, the few extant bronze bases, such as that of the Croatian Apoxymenos, are considerably larger. The thin bronze plate used to secure &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt;, together with the remains of an applied solder on the top surface, was not likely to function on its own as the original base. Analysis of the baseplate indicated that though it was composed of high-lead, low-tin bronze, the composition was markedly different than that of the figure, the detached hand and forearm, and the python.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the rest of the figure, the baseplate shows no sign of exposure to fire. The relative lack of corrosion on the baseplate further indicates that it was not the original base. Where the plate has not been protected by the solder, the corrosion layer is thin and of a generally uniform depth (about 50µm), with no deeper penetration of the interdendritic lead. By contrast, the samples from the figure are very deeply corroded with interdendritic and intergranular corrosion extending to a depth of several millimeters, while the corrosion products are stratified in such a way as to suggest a significant change in environment at some point in the figure’s history. The plate has been exposed to the environment for long enough that some fine-scale transgranular corrosion has developed; this could be expected from exposure to the elements since the eighteenth or nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting the history of the solder use on the figure and baseplate is a challenge because there has been little compositional analysis of ancient solders. All the solders identified in this study are tin-based. Pure tin was used as a soft solder in the ancient world since the seventh century BC, but the original solder on &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt; would most likely have been a lead-tin mixture.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When molten tin comes into contact with a bronze surface, a bi-layer of the epsilon and eta phases of the copper-tin system forms very rapidly, with the epsilon phase bonded to the bronze; above the eta phase will be a layer of unreacted tin. This tin corrodes quite rapidly, and within the thick layer of solder remaining on the baseplate it has largely disappeared. The eta phase is preserved on the baseplate but is missing in the other locations of solder. Substantial remains of the epsilon phase survive on the feet of the python, and this is consistent with it having been re-attached to the tree when the statue was first displayed after excavation. Conversely, only a thin layer of the epsilon phase remains in the solder under the little toe of *Apollo*’s left foot, separated from the heavily corroded bronze by up to 100µm of corrosion product. Since bronze must have initially been adjacent to the solder for the epsilon phase to form, and the thickness of corrosion seems greater than what might form during two centuries of exposure to an inclement European climate, it has been concluded that the solder on the foot is ancient. In turn, it follows that the toe was once attached to a piece of metal, suggesting that we must now reconsider how the statue was displayed in antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lead-isotope-analyses&#34;&gt;Lead Isotope Analyses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional samples of the solder on the baseplate, as well as samples of the bronze alloys of the baseplate and right foot of the statue, were also analyzed by alpha spectrometry to determine if the radioactive nuclide ^210^Pb was present. This test for the authenticity of metal artifacts is based on the disturbance of the radiochemical equilibrium of the ^238^U decay chain during the smelting process. Ores and minerals accompanying the ore usually contain small amounts of uranium. In the decay chain of uranium, elements with different geochemical and metallurgical behavior occur. While lithophile trace elements like uranium, thorium, and radium remain in the slag, chalcophile and siderophile elements, like bismuth and lead, are taken up by the metal phase. Thus the short-lived radionuclide ^210^Pb (half-life = 22.3 years) is efficiently separated from its long-lived ancestors ^238^U (half-life = 4.4 x 10^9^ years) and ^226^Ra (half-life = 1,600 years). The concentration of ^210^Pb in the metal depends on the origin of the ore and the manufacturing process, so it cannot be used for dating. The ^210^Pb in the metal then decays with its own half-life of 22.3 years and as a result of the disrupted decay chain it cannot be renewed. This means that radioactivity is usually only measurable in metals younger than about 110 years (relating to five half-lives of the nuclide).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since no measurable activity was detected in the &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt; samples, it was concluded that not only the lead in the solder but also the lead in the bronze of the baseplate and the cast-on front half of the right foot are all older than about 110 years.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It should be noted that in principle old metal could have been used to produce the objects in modern times. However, this is quite unlikely in this case considering the amounts and types of corrosion products present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relation of the bronze baseplate to the figure had puzzled scholars since the acquisition, and questions had persisted about whether it was a recent addition. However, recent results point to it having been attached to the figure in the eighteenth or nineteenth century, based on a few key facts. Compared with the corrosion of the solder remnants on *Apollo*’s foot and on the python, the solder on the baseplate is much less corroded, with the eta phase still preserved. In addition, the composition of the soft solder on the baseplate is inappropriate for an ancient solder.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most unexpected of all was the finding that the stable lead-isotope ratios of the plate were consistent with the other parts of the sculpture. In fact, all bronze parts of the statue are isotopically virtually indistinguishable, although one could argue that the two samples of the python and the sample from the cast-on right foot are slightly different from the remaining samples (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 40.6&lt;/strong&gt;). This may indicate that the same batch of lead was used but there were two different casting charges. Only the lead solder on the feet and baseplate has a clearly different lead-isotope signature. All of this information may suggest that perhaps the baseplate was reused or recast from the original sculptural assemblage, which would also be consistent with the ^210^Pb result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead-isotope ratios can also be used to determine the provenance of the lead in the alloy, because much data is available for lead deposits in the Aegean region, in southeastern Europe, and in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The lead isotope ratios of both the statue and the solder exclude a geological provenance of the lead from the Aegean and therefore Laurium, the largest source of Aegean lead in antiquity. There are not many lead ore deposits that would match the &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt;. The Cevennes in France and the Balkans are two possibilities (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 40.7&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;interpretation-of-results-and-conclusion&#34;&gt;Interpretation of Results and Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent analyses of &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt; have successfully resolved several questions that have persisted since its acquisition by the Cleveland Museum of Art over ten years ago. All of the reassembled bronze fragments of the figure, hand and forearm, and python belong together and were cast from the same melt, confirmed by metal composition, lead-isotope ratios, and corrosion history. In addition, the corrosion seems to support the figure’s purported history of use, suggesting that it was exposed to an exterior atmosphere for an extended time after excavation. The figure also displays evidence of having been in a fire, which appears to have happened after its excavation; this may be partially responsible for some of the damage that is now evident on the right side. The recent testing was also successful in revealing more information about the baseplate, which does not appear to be entirely original. Though the baseplate’s corrosion differs from that of the remainder of the figure, it shares a lead-isotope signature, leading to the conclusion that the base may be a repurposed part of the original sculptural assemblage. The lead-tin solder used to attach the sculpture to the baseplate has tested as over 110 years old, and it appears to have been done around the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. An incised line cut into the baseplate to follow the contour of the right foot is corroded over but not sufficiently corroded to indicate that the join is ancient, further supporting this claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the fire that may have damaged &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt;, an attempt was recently made to explore when that occurred. Two samples of charcoal were obtained from the edge of the separated forearm for carbon dating, but the results produced dates that were substantially older than the Greek or Roman periods (see fig. 40.7). One possible explanation for this is contamination of the samples with modern, oil-based materials used during previous restoration efforts. These restorations have also made it difficult to document evidence of manufacture, such as wax-to-wax joins, drips, and tool marks often seen on the interior of bronzes. Recently, CT scans were obtained in an effort to better document features that may lie beneath the plaster, wire mesh, and modern resins used to reassemble the figure over the years. However, the high lead content has made imaging a challenge. A few scans of the detached hand and python have been obtained, but more work is necessary to improve the clarity of the images. In fact, the attempt to image &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt; is exemplary of the multiple efforts over a dozen years to better understand the figure; each step forward in obtaining more information leads to additional questions. While we have certainly advanced our understanding of the sculpture, it is clear that the Cleveland &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt; will continue to provide new opportunities for research for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;Metallography of the figure, detached hand and forearm, lizard, and baseplate was performed by Peter Northover in early 2014 with a report submitted on March 31, 2014. These analyses were compared with published compositional analyses of classical sculpture, including Craddock 1985; Mattusch 1996. For standardization between methods of analyses, see Mattusch 1996 and Northover and Rychner 1998.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34;&gt;↥&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;Eight samples were selected and removed with a stainless steel drill bit and analyzed by Ernst Pernicka in the spring and summer of 2014. The final report of these analyses was submitted August 28, 2014. The samples were first cleaned mechanically under magnification to remove corrosion and nonmetallic material before analyzing with EDXRF. The lead-isotope ratios were determined with a multicollector-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) after chemical separation of the lead.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34;&gt;↥&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;A bronze melt sufficiently rich in oxygen will solidify as a mixture of copper, cuprite, and cassiterite; it is possible that fragments of building debris or ash are also included, and this may make the lump more of a slag. In nonequilibrium conditions, cassiterite can exist in contact with bronze. The temperature suggested by this lump is approaching 1000ºC.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34;&gt;↥&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34;&gt;Refer to table 40.4 for percentages. The first sample taken from the base, no. R2320, had 3.4% tin and 19.5% lead, and the alloy was confirmed by the second cross-section obtained in 2013, no. R4780.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34;&gt;↥&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:8&#34;&gt;Only a few quantitative analyses of ancient solder have been undertaken, but these suggest that lead-tin solder was regularly used from the late first millennium BC onward: Drescher 1959; Fasnacht and Northover 1991; Wolters 1996.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:8&#34;&gt;↥&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:9&#34;&gt;Further details of the method are published in Pernicka et al. 2008.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34;&gt;↥&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:10&#34;&gt;The seeming inconsistency with the first measurement of ^210^Pb is probably due to the very small sample size (less than 5 mg) that was first submitted and may have been taken from the surface of the object where it could have been contaminated with ^210^Pb from the environment. Furthermore, this sample had a rather unusual and different composition from the other solder samples. The sample was described in an earlier conservation report as “Apollo figure: from the base, proper right foot, instep near the toes,” but no further detailed documentation is available.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:11&#34;&gt;All samples of solder that were mechanically removed from both the top and bottom of the baseplate consist of a lead-tin alloy with about 30–40% tin.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient Athenians are reported to have been the first to erect herms that served as boundary markers in both urban and rural settings and also stood in the entrances of private homes and temples; at one location herms became so numerous that one structure near the Agora was named the Stoa of the Herms. This proliferation and high demand perhaps led to the development of copying and serial reproduction methods, and the Getty Herm of Dionysos (J. Paul Getty Museum inv. 79.AB.138, dated 200–100 BC) may therefore represent one of many examples in both marble and bronze. Further visual, endoscopic, and radiographic examinations provide important details regarding its production technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of the Getty herm (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 41.1&lt;/strong&gt;) have characterized the alloy and many casting features. Metallographic study revealed elements of the bronze cast structure and chemical analysis quantified the base alloy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Further comparative technical and art historical studies have focused to an extent on its similarities to the closely related bronze herm from the Mahdia wreck now in the Bardo Museum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lead-isotopic studies classified sources for lead found in both the bronze alloy and lead fill, and provided baseline information on the smelting history of the bronze. These studies have led to further scholarly discussion on the role of copying and serial production in ancient bronze production.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Structure:&lt;/em&gt; The herm is characterized by a bearded head topping a tall architectonic shaft. The shaft of the Getty herm was probably cast from a construction of wax slabs, and an internal wax-to-wax join was observed connecting the upper portion of the shaft to the head.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Additionally, a series of horizontal ridges or flashings is present at various heights on the interior. The shaft also includes remnants of a rod system attached to the inner walls. The remains have been considered variously to have been part of an armature support used during the building of the shaft in wax, or a sprue system for casting, a feature considered anomalous for ancient foundry work. Metallographic study of a tube-wall section shows a contiguous structure throughout indicating that the rods and wall were cast in the same pour.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Woody material found within the cross section has also led to speculation that the rods were initially modeled of wood or reed, which disintegrated during the wax burnout. Carbonized remains may have partially blocked bronze flow during the pour, creating hollow tubes as bronze flowed around charred organic material.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copper Alloy Analysis:&lt;/em&gt; The most recent analysis of interior samples (1 and 2) shows compositions consistent with ancient lead-tin bronze alloys (&lt;strong&gt;table 41.1&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lead concentrations range from 14 to 22% with tin concentrations ranging approximately from 8 to 14%. Cobalt levels were determined to be less than 0.005 weight percent in the internal lead deposit (sample 3) while present in higher concentration in the bronze alloy itself (at 0.15 and 0.20 weight percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead Isotopes:&lt;/em&gt; Lead isotope studies provided both lead sourcing (&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) and smelting information (&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Isotopic ratios suggest different lead sources for the alloy lead and a lead deposit on the herm interior. While the alloy falls within the Aegean field, the purer lead lies outside this grouping. Lead 210 (&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) was also evaluated in the three samples (two alloy, one lead) to better understand the smelting history of the bronze. If present in sufficient amounts, &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;, with a half-life of 22.2 years, could indicate smelting in the last 75–100 years. The study concluded there was negligible &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb in the bronze alloy, and none was detected in the sample of purer lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical Comparisons to Mahdia Herm:&lt;/em&gt; Studies of the Getty and Mahdia herms point to physical similarities as well as differences between the two sculptures.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Comparative facial measurements show close correspondences, although the beard and drapery show greater variation.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The physical similarities have led to discussion of ancient serial production and even speculation that the Getty herm is a twentieth-century copy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the end, there are many similarities but few of the exact correspondences that would be expected from a directly molded copy. The drapery on the heads of the two bronze herms have generally similar masses and proportions, but are completely different in method of execution. While the complex and undercut Mahdia herm drapery is generally attributed to direct working of the wax, the Getty herm drapery, with its simpler and softer form, is seen as the product of molding and indirect casting. As Carol Mattusch succinctly states, “Neither herm is the original, and neither one is a replica of the other, ancient or modern.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-observations&#34;&gt;Further Observations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Getty herm was studied in an effort to clarify and provide further insights into its production technology and burial alteration. Selected tomographic images of localized areas of the head were used to compare wall cross sections. Microscopic examination of the extant eye also shows a complex assembly consistent with other ancient composite eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condition and Mineralization of Bronze:&lt;/em&gt; Inspection of the interior and exterior surfaces reveals a range of copper corrosion types and thicknesses. The exterior patina is generally green (malachite) with scattered blue deposits (azurite); isolated thinly patinated areas reveal bronze metal. Corrosion on the interior is relatively intact where azurite has formed thicker botryoidal deposits, in particular where conditions may have favored its formation, e.g. within the head &lt;strong&gt;(fig. 41.2&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The torn area around the missing boss is heavily mineralized as is the fractured bottom edge of the shaft. A large, gray oxidized deposit on the lower inner wall is a lead remnant possibly related to the original installation (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 41.3&lt;/strong&gt;; see table 41.1, sample 3). A smaller unanalyzed gray deposit, presumably lead, can also be noted further up the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herm Pillar:&lt;/em&gt; Discussion of the internal rods has focused on the hollow rod remains, although solid remains are extant as well. The remains are centered vertically on each wall of the shaft, although there are many sections where the rods are only suggested by extant attachment points. Spanning the height of each of the four shaft walls, the total length of rod would have originally reached approximately 320 cm (4 x 80 cm); extant partial remains represent approximately 20% of this total. Preliminary observation indicates more solid rod remains on the side walls, while tubular remains predominate on the front and rear walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large repaired flaws visible in radiographs indicate casting problems below the phallus, at the rear center and on the lower rear wall (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 41.4&lt;/strong&gt;). The founder filled most of the voids by casting in bronze; in some instances, cast repairs were mechanically repaired with rectangular patches. Perhaps coincidentally, the large repairs are collinear with the vertical rod remains. Small rectangular patches (approximately 140) are visible elsewhere on the herm (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 41.5&lt;/strong&gt;), while some areas of porosity, particularly on the more complex head, were left uncorrected.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A curvilinear flow feature is also visible in radiographs extending around the pillar below the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herm Head:&lt;/em&gt; Interior inspection of the boss and beard cavity reveals extensive metal spattering. The morphology of the metal clusters suggests spillage into an open space, as opposed, for example, to seepage into a cracked or damaged section of core. The splatter is localized toward one side of the head and is absent in other parts of the herm. Perhaps related, the herm head has areas of casting porosity, and external markings at the top rear drapery of the head suggest possible cold working by a flat chisel.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These marks are absent from the smoother cast surfaces of adjoining drapery folds (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 41.6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remnants of the extant eye were investigated microscopically and with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 41.7&lt;/strong&gt;). Use of calcareous stone (not ivory as previously reported) is indicated by high calcium levels,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shiny inclusions, and faint abrasion marks.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Remnants of broken copper eyelashes surround the eye and are pressed into the eye socket. Inspection from the interior reveals that the eye has been reattached with a modern resin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several CT cross sections of the Getty head confirm a fairly uniform wall thickness indicative of a molded wax model. Comparison to the Mahdia head CT at eye level also shows some close internal profile correspondences (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 41.8&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; An outer drapery fold of the Mahdia herm (direct work) generally corresponds to a fold on the Getty herm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Herm Model and Ancient Molding:&lt;/em&gt; The herm type is distinct in combining natural and architectonic shapes. The heads themselves could vary in type, style, and material (marble, terracotta, bronze) and some marble versions of herms (of Hermes for example) have lower relief and simpler detail. From the perspective of a copyist/molder, the shaft is perhaps of less consequence than the characteristic face and beard whose production might be expedited through molding. The simpler face and frontal beard could be molded with a single mold section while a more complete mold of the head including any drapery would require a more sophisticated approach. This could be accomplished using a range of materials such as clay, plaster, and possibly pitch/bitumen.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Fired clay was typically used for smaller, less complex molds as dimensional instability (warpage and shrinkage) precluded use for multipart and complex undercut molds. In contrast, plaster piece-molding was a more advanced method and, combined with outer mother molds, could capture a higher degree of detail and undercutting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal Spillage and Casting Quality:&lt;/em&gt; Bronze spillage within the head initially suggested separate metallurgical attachment of the head. Bronze joining around the perimeter of the head would have been hidden in part by the undercut beard. However, further internal and radiographic inspection shows little further evidence of a continuous seam around the lower head. Although separate joining of the head remains a possibility, the bronze splatter may in fact be associated with repair to a miscast at the top rear of the head. Post-cast cold-worked repair is further suggested by the tool marks visible on the rear drapery. The general assumption is that the figure would have been cast upright. Radiographs reveal several areas of repaired damage with some such areas in alignment with the internal rod remains. Combined with variably filled sprues and flow features visible in radiographs, this introduces the possibility that the figure was cast horizontally (possibly face down). This would have ensured a less turbulent pour and more uniform introduction of molten bronze to the entire mold with less heat loss.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tubular Remains:&lt;/em&gt; The tubular remains present a more puzzling feature of the herm. As wax model supports, they would have attached to the wax slabs to provide stability (although supports are generally not present in more complex wax models). The approach may also represent an attempt to cast smooth outer walls, reduce post-cast surface finishing, and provide for more easily removable sprues. Scholars have hypothesized that the hollow tubes may have formed as bronze flowed around a carbonized organic (wood, reed, etc.) core during casting,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; although unimpeded bronze flow would rely on near complete burnout of the organic material. Localized exterior cooling against the investment wall may also have developed variable temperatures within the rod/tube cross section producing a solidified exterior bronze skin while the interior metal remained in a liquid state and continued to flow.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Internal sprues may also have functioned as reservoirs supplying the outer walls with molten bronze during cooling and shrinkage.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Intermittent sprue/runner attachment along the internal walls would have eased post-cast removal although in instances there was excessive wall contact, possibly a result of outward pressure applied during core introduction. In the end, use of internal sprues may have inadvertently introduced another problem, as points of attachment produced thicker bronze walls that contracted and solidified more slowly than surrounding areas (resulting in large flaws).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review of Analysis:&lt;/em&gt; Analysis of the herm alloy points to a lead-tin bronze with traces of cobalt, and radiographic images suggest the composition may actually be quite variable.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The higher (by 30–40 times) amount of cobalt in the bronze alloy samples as compared to the lead sample suggests that cobalt was present within the source copper ore.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Initial studies of Bronze Age copper sources traced higher cobalt ores to Anatolia, although further studies demonstrate the more widespread occurrence of cobalt in copper ores (including on Cyprus). Combined with more recent lead isotope studies, this may indicate other points of origin for the herm and its raw materials.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-to-the-mahdia-herm&#34;&gt;Comparison to the Mahdia Herm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To produce a bronze copy of an original work of art, an artisan may (1) use methods similar to those of the original artist; (2) use an old mold; or (3) generate a new mold from the original bronze.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:27&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Production of the Getty herm in antiquity may have entailed a combination of these approaches. Comparisons between the Getty and the Mahdia herms have demonstrated the general similarities in the proportions and heads, with the closest correspondences in the more easily molded faces. Comparison of plaster reproductions of the two heads shows a general similarity of the drapery masses at the rear although they are slightly offset with different overall volumes. This suggests a less direct relationship. Additionally, one-to-one width comparisons of the drapery bands show little to no dimensional correspondence. Some contour similarities noted in CT sections may however suggest a relationship to a common source in the initial wax production (to produce a similar inner profile) with greater variation resulting from further modeling of the exteriors. The initial basic model may have been a herm with simplified head drapery as, for example, might be found in some marble types (e.g. herms of Hermes). Artisans may therefore have started with the same general model but interpreted more freely (and directly) in the drapery modeling process. Facial similarity may have been achieved through molding with clay, plaster, or pitch-containing material (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 41.9&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:28&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As concluded in previous studies, the Getty herm with slightly undercut detail suggests molding and an indirect cast. The herm shaft would be easily formed by pouring bronze into a mold formed from joined wax slabs but the more complex head required a more complex process. This work may have focused on more simply formed elements, such as the face and frontal beard, and possibly the molding of a simpler head model. The internal rods were most probably designed as casting runners/sprues aiming to reduce the finishing of the outside wall and feed bronze during cooling. The approach created some problems as evidenced by several wall repairs in line with the vertical internal tube remnants. These flaws may have developed in areas where too much wax was used to join the sprue/gate to the inner wall, increasing overall wall thickness and causing variable wall shrinkage on cooling. Additionally, the wax sprues may have contacted and bonded to the inner walls at different points during core introduction. Variable bronze flow through the mold may have resulted in both solid and hollow rod sections (piping). Metal splatter in the head initially suggested separate molding of the head and metallurgical attachment. However, the absence of a clear seam/join and probable repaired porosity at the rear of the head indicate some casting problems. This may also indicate horizontal casting, face down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously published analytical results for the herm (isotopic and alloy composition) are consistent with ancient production and, although the lead-tin bronze composition is broadly similar to that of the Mahdia herm, it does not present the same alloy composition. Isotopic results suggest an Aegean origin for lead in the bronze alloy, although the origin of the separate lead deposit is different and perhaps associated with the installation locality. The cobalt concentration in the bronze is higher than in the lead, possibly associating the cobalt with the copper ore and a more specific copper source, possibly Anatolian. Considered in combination with stylistic Aphrodisian and Pergamene parallels and a signature by Boethos of Calkedon (on the Mahdia herm), more consideration should be given to possible workshop origins in the eastern Mediterranean for both figures.&lt;/p&gt;

Pitch was used centuries earlier nearer to its Near Eastern sources as a component of adhesives, coatings, and caulks (Connan 1999). Pitch may also have been combined with other materials (such as clay fillers and fiber strengtheners) to create a stronger and more effective flexible mold material.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:22&#34;&gt;See Kalpakjian and Schmid 2008. The formation of thin bronze layers during shrinkage is also termed “piping” (S. Decker, pers. comm. 2016). However, leaded copper-tin alloys with wide solidification ranges (due to separation between solidus and liquidus) may, to an extent, inhibit formation of thin skins (D. Scott, pers. comm. 2016).

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:24&#34;&gt;Correlation of smelted copper to a specific source using trace elements is somewhat problematic. Gale and Stos-Gale (1992, 66) point out that “ore deposits are not homogeneous in chemical composition, even on the small scale” and “the smelting of ores under primitive conditions also introduces poorly controlled changes in the pattern of minor and trace elements in copper metal when compared with the pattern in the copper ore, especially when one considers the contribution of elements contained in the added flux” (1982, 11­­–12).

&lt;h2 id=&#34;epigraphic-and-stylistic-re-evaluation-of-the-piombino-apollo&#34;&gt;Epigraphic and Stylistic Re-evaluation of the Piombino Apollo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Piombino Apollo (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.1&lt;/strong&gt;) was among the statues gathered for the exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World&lt;/em&gt; at the J. Paul Getty Museum and the accompanying symposium.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is an Archaizing work, as was already suggested by Jean Letronne in 1834, just two years after the bronze was discovered in the sea off the west coast of Piombino, Italy. Letronne’s interpretation was not accepted at the time, as the debate was then focused on the question of whether it was an Archaic or an Archaistic work. Later scholars moved on to another question: was it an Archaistic work from the fifth century BC or from the Hellenistic period? Even after Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway published a fundamental study of the statue in 1967, in which she convincingly argued in favor of a date at the end of the Hellenistic period, there were still those who doubted her conclusions. This was particularly so because a subsidiary question remained without an answer. This question was linked with the loss, more than a century before, of a fragmentary inscribed lead strip, said to have been found within the statue, on which the names of two Hellenistic sculptors were said to have been engraved. Because that lost inscription had been declared a fake—and this assertion could no longer be verified—Ridgway’s dating was not accepted as proved. A further step supporting a Late Hellenistic date was the discovery in 1977 of another bronze Apollo&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at Pompeii, in the House of Gaius Julius Polybius, that appeared to be so close in attitude and style that the two statues were declared virtual twins, possibly elaborated from the same master molds.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the opportunities afforded by the exhibition &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt; was to accommodate close comparisons between similar statues put on display together. For the first time, the two Apollos were shown in the same room and it appeared that, even if they obviously hark back to the same prototype and both are associated with the same Late Hellenistic and Early Imperial retrospective trend, their differences are as important as their similarities. The Piombino Apollo is squatter and less slender, while the Pompeian Apollo is taller. Unearthed with bronze tendrils, the latter was originally conceived as a &lt;em&gt;trapezophoros lychnouchos&lt;/em&gt;, a decorative tray-bearer for adorning and lighting a triclinium.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The tendrils, when fixed in the statue’s hands, were intended to support a &lt;em&gt;ferculum&lt;/em&gt; (a table top), on which to place lamps or other items for the banquet. No traces in the hands of the Piombino Apollo indicate that he too would have been a &lt;em&gt;lychnouchos&lt;/em&gt; by original intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fragments of the inscribed lead strip, which were rediscovered in the Louvre’s storerooms in 2010, were shown close to the statues in &lt;em&gt;Power and Pathos&lt;/em&gt;. During the restoration of the bronze in 1842, the lead strip had been extracted in four fragments with great difficulty through the empty eye sockets, at the same time that very hard material remaining in the chest was removed. Three of fragments had been preserved. As noted above, they retain two partial Greek names, which were deciphered in the year of their discovery but immediately declared a forgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once rediscovered, the strip as well as the sculptors’ names were proved authentic by the historian and epigraphist Nathan Badoud, who recently republished the inscription.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He confirmed the name of the first artist, Menodotos of Tyre, and proposed Xenophon of Rhodes for the second one. The fragment that did not survive was the longest, and the second in sequence. The inscription is currently read as “Menodotos of Tyre and Xenophon of Rhodes made it”. Menodotos belonged to a well-known Rhodian family workshop. He was the son of Artemidoros, the founder of the workshop, who had emigrated from Tyre and had settled on Rhodes in the 150s BC. According to Badoud, Menodotos was active from about 129 to 100 BC. Other known signatures, which survive on stone bases, attest that he worked with his father and with his younger brother Charmolas.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The lead strip from inside the Piombino Apollo reveals a third collaboration, which could have been with Xenophon, son of Pausanias. (The signature with Charmolas comes from Athens.) When he worked with his father, Menodotos elaborated a bronze portrait of Pasiphon, son of Epilykos, who was priest of Athana Lindia and therefore eponymous for the year 124 BC. This portrait was erected in the Rhodian sanctuary of Athana (or Athena) Lindia. And indeed, according to Badoud, regarding the Piombino Apollo, another clue might lead to the same Rhodian sanctuary. The votive three-line silver inlaid inscription, cut after casting into the statue’s left foot, gives not only the two last letters of the dedicator’s name but also two lines indicating that the statue was offered to Athena as a tithe. Thus, it is a statue of Apollo dedicated to Athena. The alphabet, the letters’ shapes, and the meaning of the dedication point to the Rhodian sanctuary of Athana Lindia where a tradition of visiting gods is firmly attested.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the Piombino Apollo fits in well with an Eastern Archaizing sculptural tradition of the Late Hellenistic period, as illustrated by a marble head from Rhodes, larger than life-size and echoing a bronze in having inserted eyes, now lost (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.2&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The similarities lie in the particular rendering of the sophisticated parted hair, with the presence of a thin fillet; in the two overlapping rows of corkscrew curls around the forehead; in the sinuous and broad incised lines that start from the top of the head; and even in the rendering of the ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the fact that the statue was most probably made in Rhodes during the last quarter of the second century BC is supported by external evidence. This accurate context justified a scientific re-examination of the statue, which is the subject of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;laboratory-re-examination-of-the-piombino-apollo&#34;&gt;Laboratory Re-examination of the Piombino Apollo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytical Procedure:&lt;/em&gt; An endoscopic examination was first performed during a kind of multi-disciplinary brainstorming session within the bronze gallery of the Louvre Museum and then at the sickbed of the statue, as it were, in the laboratory, around which a number of eminent scholars gathered.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This day marked the beginning of the technological re-examination of the statue. In addition to endoscopy and a very careful examination by eye, extensive X-radiography was carried out at the Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Musées de France (C2RMF) (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.3&lt;/strong&gt;). Fourteen bronze samples were also taken by micro-drilling in order to document and to compare the elemental composition of the different parts of the statue; these samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission (ICP-AES).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nondestructive analyses of the silver and copper inlays were performed by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), thanks to the AGLAE particle accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal composition:&lt;/em&gt; A high-lead bronze was chosen for the primary castings, and the composition is virtually the same for all parts of the statue (head, body, arms, legs, fingers): 6% tin and 19.5% lead. The lips, eyebrows, and nipples are made of unalloyed copper: no tin, up to 2% lead. The letters of the inscription on the foot are inlaid with silver slightly alloyed with copper (3%), and containing 0.5% gold as its main impurity (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.4a&lt;/strong&gt;; see also &lt;strong&gt;table 42.1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;table 42.2&lt;/strong&gt; for the complete results).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alloy used as filler metal for welding (the so-called secondary casting) matches perfectly the one used for primary castings (head to body, left and right feet to the corresponding legs), with two exceptions: the join of the right arm to the body (sample FZ20669-d), and the join of the pinkie finger to the right hand (sample FZ20669-g), which contain more tin and less lead (see fig. 42.4a).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the fourth toe of the right foot (sample FZ20669-n) was repaired in antiquity, as can be seen very clearly on a detail of the X-radiograph: a tenon was inserted in the foot at the base of the broken toe, and the missing part was directly cast on the tenon. Here, the alloy is also different, only 4% tin and 12% lead (see fig. 42.4a). Given the difference in the alloy, it seems more likely that the toe repair was not made in the original workshop but was part of a later restoration, during the ancient “lifetime” of the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the main impurities in the metal, the first thing to notice is that the primary and secondary castings share identical impurities spectra: a global level of 0.6%, with arsenic and sulfur as the main impurities (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.4b&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern observed for the fourth toe is very different, with high levels of arsenic, bismuth, antimony, and zinc, confirming the hypothesis of a later repair. Interesting is the fact that the weld join of the right arm, which shows a peculiar alloy, is also distinctive for its impurities, and quite close to the pattern of the fourth toe. This may suggest that the restoration was not limited to the replacement of the fourth toe, but that the statue underwent a major intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the copper inlays, at least two impurities patterns stand out from that of the primary castings: iron-rich without arsenic for the eyebrows; and arsenic- and iron-rich for the lips and the nipples (see table 42.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;casting-technique-working-the-wax&#34;&gt;Casting technique: Working the Wax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wax was primarily worked by the indirect process, resulting in thin and even metal walls. We were able to take a limited number of direct measurements using a thickness gauge, through the eyes of the statue and at the aperture of the feet. The walls were between 3 and 4 mm thick, and X-radiography confirmed that the metal walls were of a consistent thickness throughout (see fig. 42.3).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Based on X-radiography combined with surface and endoscopic examinations, we concluded that wax was used to fill the inside of smaller details in relief, such as the nose, the ears, the toes, and the fingers. Given also the fact that no wax-to-wax joins were detected, except for a bib-like shape below the neck, the artisans probably used the slush technique: some liquid wax was poured into the corresponding molds of each section to deposit a layer of uniform thickness, the excess liquid wax being subsequently removed by inverting the mold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A noticeable exception to the indirect process is the complex hairstyle, which shows some extra work done in the positive of the wax (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.5&lt;/strong&gt;). In the skull area, each strand of hair has been very finely figured and engraved in the wax. Hair undulations combine with slight indentations of the head to produce the effect of a stepped hairstyle in four successive waves. At the forehead, from ear to ear, the strands end in a double row of corkscrew curls, which were directly carved and then added to the head one by one (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bib-like shape below the neck previously mentioned corresponds to the only detectable wax-to-wax join. The Piombino Apollo is not the only case to present this peculiar feature: other examples of statues from the Late Hellenistic and Early Imperial periods are also known.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is possible that this join could indicate a certain division of labor in the workshop, where the most intricate parts such as face and hair, requiring extensive, delicate work on the wax, were made by a very skilled craftsman, and then added to the other parts of the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;casting-technique-joining-the-parts&#34;&gt;Casting Technique: Joining the Parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X-radiographs helped to determine the join locations (see fig. 42.3), allowing us to infer a &lt;em&gt;casting map&lt;/em&gt;, which lists the separately cast parts and shows where the wax model was cut.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the statue was cast in nine or ten sections: head, body, arms, legs, two fingers, and the anterior parts of the feet. At least one of the legs would likely have been cast separately. But the join is so perfect that we were unable to detect it. Thus, one leg may or may not have been cast together with the body (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.7&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flow fusion welding process was used to join the different sections of the statue, involving a filler metal of the same composition as the one used for the primary castings (see also ”Working the Wax,” above).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The high-level mastery in joining is a very meaningful aspect to record: not only were the bronze casters able to use a broad array of preparation techniques, but they also achieved welds without any defects. Three different preparations for the joins were observed. First, welding in basins for the arms (see fig. 42.5): such joins are known from at least the fifth century BC to the third century AD.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Second, platform welding for the head and between the legs (see fig. 42.5 and &lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.8&lt;/strong&gt;): this kind of preparation is not known before the Hellenistic period.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Third, linear joins are observed on the feet (see fig. 42.5). Such joins are totally atypical for the Late Hellenistic period but are very well known on statues from the Severe style period (ca. 480–450 BC), as for example on the Poseidon statue from Cape Artemision.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This technical trait, purposefully adopted from statues of the first half of the fifth century BC, reinforces the notion that the Apollo was executed in Archaic-revival style, as it would have been easily visible by anyone on close examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;casting-technique-core-pins-and-repairs-to-the-casting-defects&#34;&gt;Casting Technique: Core Pins and Repairs to the Casting Defects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important observations were made concerning the core pins, or chaplets (square rods measuring 3.5 x 3.5 mm in section), since they were made not of iron but of a copper alloy. Even with the help of X-radiography, they are particularly difficult to detect, and we probably missed a few of them. From those that have been detected, it seems that they were very regularly arranged, every 20 centimeters or so (see fig. 42.5). Due to their metal composition, the core pins were often partially melted during the cast. It was therefore unnecessary to remove them or to hide the corresponding holes, saving the workshop a lot of labor-intensive repairs. Such a practice is just the kind of technological marker we are looking for, as the core pins evidenced here seem very specific to the workshop that manufactured the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptional is the fact that the Apollo statue was cast virtually free of defects, compared to other statues from the Hellenistic period. The smallest defects were hidden by quadrangular bronze patches, whereas a larger lacuna on top of the head was filled by a secondary casting (see fig. 42.5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain questions concerning the Piombino Apollo remain open. Why did the sculptors hide their signatures inside the bronze? Let us remember that it was common for craftsmen to have their names inscribed on the bases that supported their works. This tradition was particularly well attested in Rhodes where there are numerous stone bases for bronze statues, from the fourth century onward, some of them signed not only by the sculptor but by the bronze-caster as well.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They could have engraved their names on the actual statues or on their plinths if there were any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hidden signatures were never supposed to be read again. But this was not the case for the votive inscription on the left foot, which could be read by anyone looking at the statue. This inscription could be interpreted as witnessing the fact that the statue once stood in a Rhodian sanctuary. If so, did the pilgrims visiting Rhodes see the Apollo statue as a true Archaic &lt;em&gt;ex-voto&lt;/em&gt; and were thus deceived by the style? Or on the contrary, did they understand it as an Archaizing creation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question concerns the shipment to Italy. The statue was found in a shipwreck, but we have no evidence that it was taken as booty or was displaced by looting. Still, the bronze does bear traces of repair. If the new study confirms that the left foot was never broken and restored in antiquity, as has been suggested more than once,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it is still clear that the fourth toe was recast and that this took place most probably when the right arm was reattached to the shoulder, since the weld join seems to come from the same metal batch. This means not only that a certain time had passed between the creation of the statue and this secondary intervention, but also that there was enough peaceful time for a restoration to be planned and completed. This doesn’t fit well with the violent desecration of a sanctuary followed by a shipment as booty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution can’t be ruled out: the possibility that Menodotos and Xenophon intentionally fabricated a forgery. The red copper inlays on the eyebrows were intended to suggest a Late Archaic or Early Classical sculpture, and so do the linear joins on the feet. In this scenario, the Apollo would have been executed directly for commercial purposes and purchased to adorn a Roman place. The votive inscription, which bestowed a Rhodian sacred origin to the statue, could have been added in order to deceive the viewer and the potential buyer regarding the true importance of the bronze.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; No one can tell, however, whether the Apollo was intended to be displayed in a Roman house as a genuine work of art, or, if slightly modified with attributes, as a &lt;em&gt;lychnouchos&lt;/em&gt;. Be that as it may, it offers the first and, up to now, only testimony of the practice of hiding signatures in a bronze statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is rare to be able to pinpoint the context of production for an ancient large bronze statue. Thus, from now on, the Piombino Apollo is to be regarded as an essential reference point not only for the study of Rhodian bronze manufacture but more generally for the knowledge of large bronzes’ manufacturing techniques during the Late Hellenistic period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few bronze statues have been uncovered on Rhodes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Technological data of such finds should be compared with those revealed by the examination of the Piombino Apollo in order to verify the extremely high level and mastery of Rhodian workshops.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As a work dated to the very end of the second century BC, the Piombino Apollo was cast with a distinctive low-tin and high-lead copper alloy with a readily identifiable pattern of impurities. The slush process was used to achieve the thin, even wax walls of the main parts of the statue, thus eliminating two possible sources of casting defects of the indirect lost-wax technique: (1) the wall thickness cannot be less than the minimum chosen by the foundryman (here 3 mm); and (2) there are no wax-to-wax joins. Distinctive core pins made of a copper alloy rather than iron are in evidence: removing them was unnecessary, thus eliminating one common cause of defects needing repair. Last but not least, the joins are extremely well executed. As a consequence, the statue appears to be virtually free of casting defects. Could these results, which reveal a high skill in casting, characterize the Rhodian industry as evoked by Carol C. Mattusch already in 1998?&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, given the well-attested intensive production of Rhodian workshops, was there something like a Rhodian bronze technique? In point of fact, statues said to have been found in Rhodes, such as the &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Eros&lt;/em&gt; at the Metropolitan Museum,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; also present very few casting defects. This is also the case for the fragments excavated within the remains of ancient Rhodian foundries, which, moreover, are all characterized by a low-tin and high-lead copper alloy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very detailed comparative studies are still required before a distinct Rhodian bronze technique can defined. The next step for research will be to explore the possible Rhodian origin of other large bronze statues and to compare the Piombino Apollo with other bronzes coming (or supposedly coming) from Rhodes or its vicinity. More works have to be investigated, in order to associate them, potentially, with the same production (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 42.9&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statue of an Apoxyomenos (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 43.1&lt;/strong&gt;), raised from the Adriatic Sea off Croatia in 1999, has been thoroughly restored and investigated at the Croatian Conservation Institute (HRZ). It has been exhibited in Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka, Split, and Zadar in Croatia, as well as in Florence, Ljubljana, Paris, London, and Los Angeles. Results of conservation-restoration works and investigations have been published and presented at several conferences, including international congresses on ancient bronzes in Bucharest (2003) and Zurich (2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, during the exhibition of the statue at the Louvre, the HRZ established a cooperation with that institution leading in 2013 to new insights into the technology of the Croatian Apoxyomenos,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and continuing in 2015 with a new campaign to analyze the alloys used to produce the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;alloy-investigation-prior-to-2013&#34;&gt;Alloy Investigation Prior to 2013&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the statue had been raised from the sea in 1999, and before its conservation, the most important tasks were to determine its state of preservation, to prepare it for transport to the HRZ in Zagreb, and to determine a conservation methodology. Therefore, while it was still on the island of Lošinj in 1999, µ-radiography with an iridium-192 source was performed, using a portable device. This process yielded images that not only showed problematic areas on the statue, such as fractures and lacunae, but also illustrated the technique by which the statue was manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conservation treatments and research performed at the HRZ in Zagreb in cooperation with the Opificio delle Pietre Dure (OPD) lasted for six years until 2006.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already in 1999 more than a hundred different samples were collected from the interior and exterior of the statue. However, the amount of metal in these samples was very small and mostly included corrosion products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a first and necessary desalination, several sampling and analytical campaigns were conducted between 1999 and 2003, by taking metal samples and by performing surface analyses during the conservation-restoration treatments. The aim was to provide information about the elemental composition of the alloys used for primary and secondary castings (including welding and repairs), soldering, patches, and inlays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of sampling between 1999 and 2002, during the initial conservation treatment, some 43 samples were analyzed at the Scientific Laboratory of the OPD (14 metal fragments, 9 solder and welding alloys samples, 20 samples of corrosion products and crystals on the internal and external surface of the bronze; &lt;strong&gt;fig. 43.2&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metal structure in the samples was found to be very heterogeneous and spongy, showing penetration of corrosion into the bronze wall on both sides (interior and exterior), especially on the rear of the statue that had been buried in sand on the seabed. Experts from the OPD performed several analyses to examine the samples, using stereomicroscopy, stratigraphic investigation under an optical microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS), and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission (ICP-AES).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant and interesting analyses and results were provided by ICP-AES and SEM-EDS, which were performed in parallel for some samples. For ICP-AES, the entire samples were dissolved in acid mixtures at the temperature of 350°C, meaning that they included “deteriorated” areas. The results showed that the bronze alloy is highly leaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since lead appears concentrated in globules of 50–200 μm and in surface areas, SEM-EDS was preferred, and only sound areas deep in the samples were investigated. Only very small areas (500 μm² or even only 100 μm²) were analyzed in the samples. SEM-EDS only gave results for major elements, but they showed a very different metal composition, with a low percentage of lead in the bronze alloy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the analyses performed by the OPD before 2003, further analyses were performed by the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and by the HRZ, based on 5 samples and applying PIXE spectroscopy. Again, the samples were heterogeneous and only one—sample no. 5859, taken from the interior of the chin—gave results similar to the ICP-AES analyses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cu 76.4% (58.9–92.5%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sn 7.1% (4.7–8.5%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pb 16.1% (2.12–32.1%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si 0.19% (0.14–0.26%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cr 0.01% (0.0–0.2%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fe 0.13% (0.7–0.17%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ni 0.03% (0.0–0.6%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, after the complete removal of the calcareous encrustations from the statue, a second campaign of investigation was carried out by the HRZ and the Ruđer Bošković Institute, applying three different analytical techniques based on X-ray: portable XRF spectrometry (70 points), external beam PIXE (same areas as XRF) and micro-PIXE using the Zagreb proton microprobe facility. These tests yielded elemental maps on cross sections obtained from two selected samples (head and right leg).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The X-ray surface analysis proved to be not representative of the bulk alloy, showing a heavily corroded surface with large discrepancies in element concentrations, thus indicating that such measurements could not estimate the original metal composition. X-ray maps on cross sections showed a typical structure of high-lead bronzes, but also that corrosion deeply affected the metal walls on both sides, up to the depth of 600 μm.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these prior investigation methods and procedures, the main problems preventing a correct determination of the elemental metal composition were metal heterogeneity, especially as regards the lead distribution, and the heavy corrosion of the statue. SEM-EDS analysis was unable to ascertain the lead level since only a volume of 0.5 mm^3^ (at the most) had been analyzed. Furthermore, SEM-EDS is not sensitive enough to detect trace elements. ICP-AES analysis was unfortunately performed on samples including “deteriorated” areas and at a very high temperature for sample digestion, leaving some doubt as to the obtained results. Given the thickness of the corroded bronze walls, surface analyses by XRF or PIXE never reached a sound metal composition. PIXE maps and other techniques based on metallographic sections required large samples, which could not be taken in significant numbers given the damage they cause to the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-examination-of-the-manufacturing-techniques-2013&#34;&gt;Re-examination of the Manufacturing Techniques (2013)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, we concluded that for an accurate determination of the metal composition, and especially the lead level, a “volumic” method was required. We also knew that great care had to be taken to avoid inclusion of corrosion products, which can strongly bias the results. But these conditions are not sufficient: before choosing appropriate locations for new samples, a comprehensive technological understanding of the statue was also needed. A re-examination of the manufacturing technique of the statue was therefore undertaken: How many separately cast sections (primary castings) are there? Where are the joins located? Were the sections soldered or welded? Where and how was the statue repaired?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our examination confirmed that the statue had been produced by an indirect lost-wax process. It is a hollow cast; that is, the casting core was removed and only minor traces of it remained. Hence the total weight of the statue is only about 125 kg, making it easily transportable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statue is made of seven main parts (head, torso, legs, arms, and genitals). Arms, legs, and genitals were joined to the torso by flow fusion welding. The head was soldered onto the neck. The plinth parts were also soldered together and the feet were then soldered to the plinth (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 43.3&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head was cast in one piece, with a bronze wall 5 to 8 mm thick. A large casting defect under the left eye was repaired by a secondary casting; smaller rectangular patches closed the core pin holes. The head-to-neck join has a very typical path with right-angle corners below the ears and platforms between the head and the neck in order to accommodate the soldering. The eye inserts are unfortunately lost but the lips are still there. They are made of unalloyed copper that was inserted into rectangular mounting channels, and finally hammered in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The torso is interesting for visible traces of manual work on the wax from the inside, in the mold. Here also, the bronze wall thickness ranges from 5 to 8 mm. There are copper inlays also for the nipples, hammered into shallow round recesses cut into the bronze surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legs show different thicknesses of the bronze wall: 4–6.5 mm for the right leg and 8–11 mm for the left. They were cast in an upright position and the majority of the casting defects, caused by massive gas emission, are visible in their upper parts. The right leg in particular shows that repairs to the cast leg as well as in the welding area were made using multiple patches—both smaller rectangular ones and larger polygonal ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hands were joined to the arms by a wax-to-wax method. Some of the fingers were cast separately. The small finger of the left hand is lost and the interior of the left hand is accessible through the hole only at this point, since the hand-to-arm join is closed on the left side. On the right side, however, it is open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before assembly, the casting core was removed from all parts of the statue. The statue was joined in five phases: (1) the arms to the torso; (2) the complex leg area (first the right leg, then the left); (3) the pubic area and genitals; (4) soldering the head onto the neck; and (5) soldering the feet onto the plinth. Joins 1–3 were performed using a flow fusion welding technique in basins for legs and arms (secondary castings of bronze). All welding areas had to be repaired with multiple patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All joins and repairs are now easily followed thanks to γ-radiography, the archeological drawings (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 43.4&lt;/strong&gt;), and new X-ray images made by the C2RMF (complete frontal and profile views).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This re-examination confirmed that the Croatian Apoxyomenos is a typical product of the Late Hellenistic period,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; though the original prototype is dated to the mid-fourth century BC according to stylistic features.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-sampling-campaign-2013-2015&#34;&gt;New Sampling Campaign (2013–2015)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking into consideration the previous metal analyses and our better understanding of the casting and welding techniques, we decided to perform additional analyses using ICP-AES. Seven new samples were taken by microdrilling (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 43.5&lt;/strong&gt;), some of them from the previously examined areas: 6 from primary castings (head, body, foot, pubic hair, decorated plinth, undecorated plinth) and 1 from a weld join (the pubic area onto the legs and the body area).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses were performed by ICP-AES at the C2RMF. About 20 mg of metal was taken for each sample (1 mm diameter, 10 mm deep) after eliminating most surface corrosion products. The drillings were carefully controlled under the stereomicroscope to avoid any corrosion product or dust. About 10 mg of the drillings were precisely weighed and digested in 5 ml aqua regia solution (hydrochloric and nitric acids). The solution was then nebulized in the argon plasma and 29 chemical elements were quantified.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The detailed results of the ICP-AES analyses can be found in &lt;strong&gt;table 43.1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using this analytical procedure, we achieved a very consistent new set of results. Regarding major elements, we observed that the same alloy has been used for the primary castings of all parts of the statue, including the undecorated rear face of the plinth (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 43.6&lt;/strong&gt;). It appears that the alloy of the Croatian Apoxyomenos is a highly leaded bronze (Sn 6.7 ± 1.9%; Pb 18.0 ± 4.0%); this alloy was also used for welding. A noticeable exception is the decorated side of the plinth, showing higher tin contents and lower lead (Sn 9.5%; Pb 11.0%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, all high-lead bronze parts share the same trace-elements pattern (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 43.7&lt;/strong&gt;), and confirm that they are made from the same copper: a typical 0.1% level of silver, arsenic, and antimony and about 0.03 % nickel. One notable discrepancy is in the iron and zinc levels. As these two elements are very easily oxidized from bronze in the liquid state, a possible explanation could be a delayed casting for some parts of the statue, i.e., some liquid metal was left at high temperature for too long, thus leading to some oxidation of the metal batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very interesting is the fact that the corresponding impurities pattern is not only consistent for all parts of the statue itself, but also for the undecorated side of the plinth. We can therefore deduce that this part of the plinth was cast at the same time as the rest of the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the distinct alloy of the decorated plinth face and its lower impurities pattern (Ag/Bi/Sb only), it is very likely that the decorated parts of the plinth were manufactured in a later phase. It seems possible that a major restoration and/or modification of the plinth occurred already during the ancient life of the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equestrian bronze group of Alexander on horseback in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples (inv. 4996), which is dated around the first century BC, was found in Herculaneum during the Bourbon excavation campaigns of the second half of the eighteenth century (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 44.1&lt;/strong&gt;). According to the sources, the statuette, whose restored height is 49 centimeters, was mostly excavated on October 22, 1761, within a tunnel at the Theater under the Casa dei Colli Mozzi. Upon discovery, the legs and tail of the horse, as well as the legs and right arm of the rider, were missing. Subsequently, between October 24 and November 21, 1761, these were brought to light.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eyes of the horse and rider, the rosette that holds the mantle (on the right shoulder rather than on the left, as indicated in the excavation report), and the mask that decorates the horse’s breastplate were described as inlaid in silver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restoration was carried out shortly thereafter in the Reale Fonderia of Portici, as evidenced by the three rosettes painted on the base (the logo of the foundry), under the direction of Camillo Paderni, Custodian of the Royal Museum, where all of the fragments were transferred. In a report dated June 5, 1762, Paderni writes that “the restoration proceeds very well and that the statuette would become one of the most important items of the Royal Museum.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1762, while the restoration was in progress, J. J. Winckelmann, in a letter to Count Heinrich von Bruel,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; provides an interesting description of the statuette. He says that “an arm of the rider and two legs of the horse are missing,” which, however, “have been restored,” that “the eyes of the horse and rider and bridle are inlaid in silver and that the base is preserved.” Winckelmann also adds that the equestrian group and a prancing horse, found in the same area of the Theater of Herculaneum, “are not shown to visitors because of the restoration, which is still ongoing.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1764, in a letter to Heinrich von Fuessly, Winckelmann once again describes the statuette, which was still under restoration: “missing left arm”; “the right arm is raised”; “the legs are both present”; “the feet are shod”; “lacks the hind legs of the horse”; “the rudder is present”; “the base is decorated with silver inlays on one of the short sides.” By the 1770s, the restoration had been completed and the statuette of Alexander on horseback was exhibited in the middle of the eleventh room of the Herculanean Museum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1820, finally, it was displayed among the bronzes in the Real Museo Borbonico in Naples,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; although the vicissitudes of the various fragments of the artworks were not yet over.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perception that the Alexander on horseback was an exceptional find is also attested by the fact that a cast of the statue was the first to be created and sent to King Charles III in Madrid. The object had been brought to light, in fact, after the king’s departure for Spain in 1759, and the replica was crafted in order to inform him of the exceptional discovery. The plaster was executed and signed by Antonio Reder (employed in the Reale Fonderia under the direction of Paderni), who made the work so masterfully that it may be considered a sculpture in its own right rather than a simple copy. During transport from Portici to Madrid, however, despite careful packaging, the plaster, currently on display in Madrid in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, was badly damaged: the arms and legs of the knight and part of the horse’s tail were broken and lost.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statue of Alexander on horseback, which represents one of the most complete representations of the Macedonian leader, is considered by many to be a miniature copy of the central figure of the bronze group by Lysippos dedicated by Alexander in the sanctuary of Zeus at Dion in Macedonia to commemorate the twenty-five Companions who in 334 BC lost their lives in the battle against the Persians on the Granicus River. The original bronze group, which was renowned in Hellenistic and Roman times, was brought to Rome in 146 BC by Quintus Caecilius Metellus, who exhibited it in the Porticus Metelli. The discovery in Herculaneum, also in the Theater, of two other bronze equestrian statuettes—a prancing horse and an Amazon on horseback—might, according to some scholars, evoke the story told by Kleitarchos of Alexandria of the love between Alexander and Thalestris, queen of the Amazons. Alexander on horseback could be, therefore, a Roman adaptation of Hellenistic prototypes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-examination-of-the-technological-features&#34;&gt;Visual Examination of the Technological Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The static consolidation intervention recently undertaken on this work required the temporary disassembly of the four main constituent pieces: rider, horse, base, and rudder (supporting piece), which are mechanically assembled by means of several screws and five bolts. This allowed a careful visual and radiographic examination and the identification of most of the independent metal pieces constituting the statuette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Base:&lt;/em&gt; The base (about 230 × 430 mm) is a relatively thin casting (a few millimeters thick) reinforced with a peculiar diagonal metal cross (saltire-like), well-joined on its inner surface. The latter exhibits greenish encrustations along with residues of mortar and lead, which were likely intended to fix the piece on a larger base. Two symmetric plugs in proximity of the short sides are also recognizable on the base, the inner surfaces of which present corrosion phenomena similar to those of the surrounding metal. Very interestingly, one of these plugs is traversed by the threaded end of the rudder (one of the aforementioned bolts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floral and geometrical decorations made with white metal are visible on the upper surface of the base, although some motifs are deeply worn and others are obscured by dark patination layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horse:&lt;/em&gt; The body of the horse appears rather well preserved, while its limbs and tail include very obvious joins. These were executed using various anchoring techniques: small copper alloy inserts, rivets, and soft soldering.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The use of a small metal insert is particularly evident on the left hind leg (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 44.2a&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This restoration technique is also attested in other objects from the Vesuvian area, such as the famous Tripod with Sphinxes from Herculaneum preserved in the Naples Archaeological Museum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saddlecloth, girth, harness, and reins are fashioned from perfectly shaped thin copper foils and strips, soldered onto the body of the horse with tin-lead alloys (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 44.3&lt;/strong&gt;). However, the breastplate up to its lateral soft-soldered phalerae seems more refined than the saddlecloth and girth and presents a clear join at the right point of the shoulder. There are objective clues suggesting that the saddlecloth was likely added during the eighteenth-century restoration. As shown in figure 44.3a, it is shaped from two copper laminae and then carefully cut out and filed along the back and the contour of the terminal part of the mane at the withers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 44.3 also evidences another crucial feature. The locks of the mane were suitably cut and smoothed (fig. 44.3a) in order to better fit the rider’s skirt (fig. 44.3b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rider:&lt;/em&gt; Examination of the rider indicates that its limbs were anchored to the body by molten copper alloys poured from the inner side, while two damaged zones of the skirt were fixed using a copper foil, which was soft-soldered to the inner side of the skirt (see the left side-arrows in fig. 44.2b). The thighs with the integrated stretches of the skirt perfectly fit the curvatures of the garment and of the ribs at the inner and outer sides, respectively. The limbs were likely originally cast separately and then joined to the trunk of the figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;radiographic-examination&#34;&gt;Radiographic Examination&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several radiographic images were taken in order to identify each of the independent pieces composing the sculpture and to interpret its execution and repair history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Base:&lt;/em&gt; In addition to a detailed assessment of features that were already evident to the naked eye, the radiography of the base provided crucial information regarding its authenticity. The base has a variable thickness and moderate porosity. As shown in &lt;strong&gt;figure 44.4a&lt;/strong&gt;, the two large plugs mentioned above are very thin and present the typical perimetric housing. The white metal decorations were achieved via a heat process: after creating suitable recesses and cutting the decorative motives from a silver foil,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the latter were soldered by first immersing them in a tin-lead bath (see the round porosities in &lt;strong&gt;fig. 44.4b&lt;/strong&gt;), and then hammering them into place. Thus, the damascening of the base was not achieved simply by mechanical inlay but a rather through a more elaborate decorative process, in order to increase the durability of the artwork. The authenticity of this decoration and thus of the entire base is also supported by the random consumption of the silver foils and the total loss of some details (see the different radio-opacity of the petals in fig. 44.4b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horse:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 44.5&lt;/strong&gt; shows the reconstructed general view of the horse composed from two images as well as two side details of its neck. These confirm that this artifact is a hollow casting including several interesting structural details described below. The thicknesses of the metal walls are not entirely contrasted in X-ray images because of the radio-opacity of the core, which is mostly still inside the horse; note the abrupt change of radio-opacity at the ideal line between the chest and the withers. A significant macroporosity, produced by fragments of the core materials and air bubbles trapped in the metal, extends from the head to the chest and shoulders of the horse, while the rest of the body shows a higher casting quality. Joint stretches are evident in the repair zones of the limbs and tail (see arrows in fig. 44.5). Furthermore, figure 44.5 proves that the head, body, and limbs of the horse were originally cast independently and then joined by means of hard heat joins (i.e., by filling the gaps with molten bronze). The intentional cut of the wax model before casting can be argued from the straight stretches of unfilled zones of the joins of the neck and left forearm (solid arrows in fig. 44.5). The join of the neck includes a kind of parallelogram-shaped bronze patch at the right side, which exhibits a slightly higher radio-opacity than the main metal wall, possibly due to a higher lead content and/or thickness. Drips are also recognizable in this join zone. They descend from the apex of the joint itself. However, the latter also shows a relatively high radio-opacity, thus making it difficult to determine the origin of the drips: they could have been produced either by cutting wax with a hot tool or by a modern repair using a tin-lead alloy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the joins of the limbs and tail were thoroughly investigated. In each case, the repair includes the preparation of suitable housings to be used as mechanical anchors. In particular, the assembly of the forelegs and cannon bones are apparently purely mechanical, while other joins also involved soft solder, such as those at the level of gaskins (see fig. 44.5) and tail (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 44.6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radiographic investigation also demonstrated the perfect fit of the middle stretch of the hind legs and tail, which definitely belong to the original artifact. It is also evident that the lower parts of the limbs were originally solid, although nothing can be said about the authenticity of the present terminal zones from cannons to heels and cannon to hoofs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rider:&lt;/em&gt; The cast of the rider is mostly hollow, with the exception of most of the limbs, whose initial hollow stretches (see for example the right leg in &lt;strong&gt;fig. 44.7b&lt;/strong&gt;) were exploited by Bourbon restorers for anchoring them to the body of the figure by pouring in molten bronze. These modern repairs were not entirely successful since the limbs are not perfectly blocked. The neck seems to show traces of a possibly original heat join, although this cannot be objectively demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wall thicknesses of the body vary considerably. In particular, thickenings are observed at the reliefs of the armor and draping of the mantle, suggesting the direct shaping of the wax model for casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chemical-analysis-of-the-alloys&#34;&gt;Chemical Analysis of the Alloys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the examinations described above allow us to identify most of the individual pieces comprising the present sculptural group. These are rendered in different colors in &lt;strong&gt;figure 44.8&lt;/strong&gt;, where the sites of the compositional characterization are also marked. The latter was carried out using laser induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS or LIBS). In this noninvasive technique, short laser pulses are focused on the material of interest and its elemental weight fractions are derived through spectral analysis of the bright plasma plumes generated at the laser focus. Several spectra are usually collected at the measurement point, which allows for an elemental depth profile within several hundreds microns, thus providing information on corrosion processes and bulk composition.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition to LIPS, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was used for quick qualitative assays of the silver decorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are summarized in tables 44.1–2, where the main alloys and those of plausible independent castings are grouped. The average composition of the horse (&lt;strong&gt;table 44.1&lt;/strong&gt;) is 11.7 ± 0.7 wt% tin and 3.6 ± 0.7 wt% lead. The lead content of the limbs and tail is significantly higher, thus supporting their probable independent casting, although the only clear evidence of an ancient join is that of the left foreleg (fig. 44.5, far right). The saddlecloth, breastplate, and reins were crafted in pure copper (impurities &amp;lt;1%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rider (&lt;strong&gt;table 44.2&lt;/strong&gt;) has an average tin weight fraction similar to that of the horse and a higher lead content: 11.0 ± 0.9 wt% tin, 10.4 ± 1.5 wt% lead. The right arm and the lower part of the sword, which is an integral part of the hand, is the only piece with a slightly different composition: 7.3 wt% tin, 7.6 wt% lead. Finally, the base has an intermediate composition between rider and horse—12.0 ± 0.2 wt% tin, 7.6 ± 0.5 wt% lead—while that of the rudder is similar to the main alloy of the horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas where traces of silver decorations were found using XRF are: the pupil, the sword pommel, the phalerae, and pendant of the rider; right phalera of the breastplate and the pupil of the horse. The presence of silver was confirmed for most of the base decoration, while in areas where the foil was consumed or completely lost, tin-lead alloys were detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elemental depth profile used to derive the above-reported compositions included approximately 1,500 spectra collected at each measurement point. They mostly exhibited the typical broad modulations associated with the corrosion effects observed in archaeological objects. The only anomalous behaviors of the tin content were those of the horse’s left hind cannon (meas. 24), right fore hoof (meas. 3), and left fore pastern (meas. 4). The depth profiles measured in these areas were rather flat, something that is typically observed in bronzes that have aged for a relatively short period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very interestingly, the rudder exhibited a broad profile congruent with lengthy burial. This piece has threaded ends and the top is screwed into a threaded copper insert in the girth of the horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equestrian group of Alexander the Great is composed of four authentic ancient bronze sculptures: rider, horse, rudder, and base. They demonstrate known as well as new aspects of the ancient foundry production. The rider and the horse were cast in pieces, and the main alloy of the latter recalls those used in the Hellenistic period for large bronzes. The alloys of the rider, base, and independent castings of the horse are more leaded, as is usual for ancient statuettes and other small bronze objects. The technological examinations and the study of the elemental depth profiles indicates that the terminal parts of three limbs were likely cast and integrated after the discovery of the artifact. The saddlecloth was either adapted to the horse or completely fabricated in modern times, while at least the front part of the breastplate is ancient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the three sculptural pieces of the group present traces of slush casting of the waxes and the rider exhibits clues of direct shaping (i.e., it seems an original model). Further investigations are needed in order to assess whether the rider and horse belong together. In particular, we suggest that future studies include the other prancing horse found in the same area of Herculaneum in order to gain further insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovery-and-introduction&#34;&gt;Discovery and Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1921, Harvard Egyptologist George A. Reisner excavated Pyramid N 6 (also called Beg. N. 6), the burial of Queen Amanishakheto, in Meroë, Sudan.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This pyramid had been discovered in the early nineteenth century by the Italian physician and explorer Giuseppe Ferlini. While investigating the pyramid, much of which was destroyed during the process, Ferlini came upon a rich trove of gold jewelry.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few objects however remained in the tomb, to be discovered only when excavations were undertaken in the stairway leading to the underground burial chamber. Most notable among these was a cache of wind instruments. Given the degraded state of their materials, the pipes must have been very brittle and difficult to handle. Unfortunately, little information is available about the circumstances of the find or how the objects were retrieved from the soil. The expedition diaries, allow a few glimpses into the discovery, however. The entry of March 23, 1921, reads in part: “found a number of bone tubes cased in bronze plate. These have holes and may have been a flute (or similar).”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On March 24, 1921, the writer elaborates: “came on a bunch of ‘flutes’ (?) about a meter or so further on. Photo and careful notes. Appear to be made in sections (bronze casing over reed or bone tubes).”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The last excavation entry of March 25, 1921, adds further information: “recording the bunch of flutes (about 18). Removed them late in the day (Sanborn and Story).”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Two high-resolution excavation photographs taken in situ are invaluable today as they show the cache both when first exposed (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 45.1&lt;/strong&gt;) and after a number of pipes had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Object Register of the excavation of March 23–25, 1921, provides a number of drawings of the more complex and interesting sections of the instruments and the following text entry: “Many fragments of at least four (probably five) flute like musical instruments. Straight tubes of ivory encased in bronze, made in sections, with round and oblong holes, mouthpieces, stops, and fittings. Length not obtainable but cannot be less than ca. 45 cm. Jointed section preserved of L. 13.1. Appear to be large and small (cf. two end pieces of different Diameters).”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These quotes help to illuminate the confusion of the excavators when encountering this find. Up to the present day, this is by far the largest group of ancient double-reed double pipes ever found together. They clearly belong to the Mediterranean types attested all over the Hellenized world, called &lt;em&gt;auloi&lt;/em&gt; in Greek and &lt;em&gt;tibiae&lt;/em&gt; in Latin.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The instruments consist of two separate pipes played simultaneously, each held in one hand and equipped with its own double reed. Innumerable ancient depictions of auloi are found in diverse media: in painted scenes on ceramics, in sculptures, engraved in gems, and in wall-paintings and mosaics. Early aulos finds are made from wood or bone, often with metal enforcement over the joints, but construction evolved over time; by the Hellenistic and especially the Roman Imperial periods, mechanically sophisticated systems made of various metals, bone, and wood were in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Meroë is located hundreds of miles south of the Mediterranean Sea, trade routes along the Nile and the Red Sea provided paths for cultural and commercial exchange with the north, as well as with western and central Asia. The metropolitan quality and sophistication of the city is reflected in surviving art and artifacts. That its inhabitants must also have enjoyed the increasingly globalized music culture known from the Mediterranean is further emphasized by a smaller group of aulos fragments excavated by John Garstang in the Royal City of Meroë, as well as by the standing figure of a nude aulete, carved from Nubian sandstone and covered with polychrome gesso (pink for flesh tones and yellow for the instrument), found, again by Garstang, in the “Royal Baths” of Meroë.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first scholarly investigation of the auloi was undertaken by Nicholas Bodley in about 1939. He came to the conclusion “that a complete restoration, even of a single instrument, is not possible.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He believed the group to be the personal instruments of a professional musician, who may have participated in the funerary rites for the queen.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The fragmentary instruments were subsequently revisited by Maurice Byrne in the 1990s, and in 2012 by Olga Sutkowska. By 2013, funds were raised by the MFA that allowed the beginning of the current conservation project, whose preliminary results will be discussed below.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conservation-approaches-and-treatment&#34;&gt;Conservation: Approaches and Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the project began, most of the elements were still stored in the wooden trays in which they were shipped from the Sudan in the 1920s (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 45.2&lt;/strong&gt;). Interspersed between the fragments were small pieces of paper with notes from the excavators, some written in Arabic. We may assume that in general each tray originally contained one instrument, except for a small number of tubes that were fused by corrosion and were lifted as an agglomerate. In Boston over the following ninety years, a certain amount of undocumented handling and sorting of the various elements and materials occurred. Some bone and bronze fragments were sorted and separated into trays; in the process, many original associations were lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the retrieval of the pipes left much to be desired, the excavators at least did not impregnate the fragments with wax or other materials favored during excavation retrieval at the time. Furthermore, prior to the beginning of the current project, no attempts at treatment had been made. We are working here with highly degraded matter, but the material is uncontaminated and unaltered by recent intervention—in other words, virgin matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our initial assessment indicated that the project would access a group of elements consisting of cylindrical wooden or bone resonators, encased in thin bronze tubing, and supplemented with non-encased bone bulbs and encased reed inserts, similar to ones known from Pompeii.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore there appeared to be a variety of types, not only based on their different diameters as already stated by Reisner, but also in terms of the numbers and density of finger holes, the length of sections, the shapes, and the types of mechanics (&lt;strong&gt;figs. 45.3–4&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rehousing&#34;&gt;Rehousing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further analysis, documentation, and interpretation of these fragments could only be carried out after the elements were stabilized and rehoused. The initial phase of rehousing and removal from the shipping containers was recorded in detail and was comparable to a controlled excavation, completely preserving information such as location and associated notes that may lead to further understanding of the fragments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wooden trays in which the fragmentary auloi had traveled the long distance from the site of Meroë in northern Sudan to Boston were recorded using high-resolution digital photography. Next, all fragments were removed from their old containers, which had permitted them to jostle against each other since their arrival in Boston almost one hundred years ago. The pieces were rehoused in state-of-the-art archival storage trays with an interior modular system of smaller boxes that allowed constant reconfiguration to serve the needs of each original particular tray. Since connections to be made between fragments during this project would lead to longer individual pipe sections, the new storage systems required the flexibility for constant adjustment. In the process, the individual pieces were cross-checked against earlier images, and their locations noted to record adjacencies that may prove to be important for future reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;joining&#34;&gt;Joining&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior bone resonators, bulbs, and reed holder fragments could now be handled fairly safely. Viewed against a cleaner background, many fragments now begged to be joined.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The bone parts, especially, exhibit specific shapes, textures, and sometimes incised surface decorations, all of which greatly helped to identify joins. The green stain observed on many parts and of varying hues was caused by contact with copper tubes in burial, and not by an original dye, as previous researchers had assumed. Many of the bulbs carried decorative silver sleeves, now mineralized to a brown, warty appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outer bronze sleeves and tubes were far more difficult to join. The thin walls of the heavily corroded, and sometimes also mineralized, metal have occasionally warped, complicating the reconstruction of the original forms. The thin-walled copper alloy tubes, however, also show distinctive patterns, related to the taphonomic micro-conditions that surrounded them. These features occasionally allow identification of pieces that belong to one tube, but may more often help corroborating hypotheses built on different grounds. Many pipes consisted of numerous short bronze tubes, joined with socket-and-tenon joins of the inner bone lining. In cases where the bone lining was separated from the metal tubes, joining of tube sections based on the material evidence alone was almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wood is so fragile that for the time being any manipulation of it is avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;material-analysis&#34;&gt;Material Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;X-radiography:&lt;/em&gt; To date, all metal elements have been examined by X-radiography (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 45.5&lt;/strong&gt;). The radiographs provide insight into the highly sophisticated fine mechanics of the auloi: uniform sections of extremely thin and straight bronze tubing (some less than 0.3 mm thick) were fitted into each other to form an airtight system. As with other aulos finds, wall thickness is basically homogenous and none of the straight tube sections show seams, with the single exception of a long piece of tubing without any mechanism.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The generally mottled appearance of the tubes is due to corrosion, which led to uneven loss of metallic substance. One particularly interesting feature seen first in the radiographs as dark lines, are straight slits or cuts on many short tubes, where thin partial rings were intentionally cut from the tube’s end. These presumably mechanical features are so far unique to the Meroë double pipes and although we have developed hypotheses about their function,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; these remain to be verified by experimental reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alloy Analysis:&lt;/em&gt; Surface analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence, a nondestructive analytical technique, provided initial semi-quantitative information on the elemental composition of various elements of the instruments: of straight tubes, knobs, and metal encasing on the bone bulbs. It appears that large sections of the round tubes were made from a copper-tin bronze. Lead was detected in areas that were once joined by soldering, and silver was found on various bone bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross Section:&lt;/em&gt; A polished and etched metal cross-section of one narrow tube revealed a highly stressed metal structure that was cold worked and annealed during manufacture. Based on this observation, it is assumed that the seamless tubes were cast from tin bronze and then likely further hammered, possible around a metal core. Final turning and smoothing of the surface with a lathe-like instrument facilitated the perfect fitting of extremely thin, straight tubes, leaving distinctive parallel marks on the metal surface (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 45.6&lt;/strong&gt;); these can be seen in a few locations on the bronze tubes that have not been mineralized by corrosion. Quantitative elemental analysis on the cross section determined that they were made of tin bronze with about 90% copper and 10% tin.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carbon 14 Dating:&lt;/em&gt; Samples from wooden core material were dated by radiocarbon analysis to between 52 BC and AD 54, congruous with the burial of Queen Amanishakheto. Her instruments were au courant!&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wood Identification:&lt;/em&gt; Analysis was carried out by Caroline Cartwright of the British Museum on five wood samples from different original storage boxes, some of them associated directly with specific bronze tubing. She identified the wood as that of Olea europaea, the European olive, which is not native to the Sudan. This suggests that the double pipes were manufactured far north of Meroë utilizing wood from the Mediterranean sphere.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bone:&lt;/em&gt; Based upon initial visual examination, the lining of many pipes, as well as their bulbs and bells, appear to have been primarily carved from bone; as mentioned above, these parts are sometimes light green in color. Different parts of the pipes appear to have been carved from different types of bone, judging by their surface textures. Such slight variances and the occasional surface decoration in the form of thin incised lines aid in establishing joins between the numerous small fragments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiber Analysis:&lt;/em&gt; Textile fibers were found on both the rotating sleeves of the instruments and the knobs by aid of which these were operated. Some of the fibers appear to wrap repeatedly around the rotating sleeve or knobs, while others are inserted into the holes of knobs (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 45.7&lt;/strong&gt;). The exact use of the fibers is not known, but it was postulated that the yarns might assist in the rotation of the sleeves in some way (perhaps by giving the player a way to turn the sleeves by pulling the yarns), or cushion the sharp top edge of the knob with wrapped fibers to make playing more comfortable. Alternatively, the yarn may have simply been used as decoration. Preliminary analysis by Joel Thompson, Associate Conservator in Textile Conservation at the MFA, has identified the fibers as extremely fine flax, although much more detailed studies are required to map the location of all fibers associated with the instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-archaeological-interpretation&#34;&gt;Music-archaeological Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late spring 2015, a group of music archaeologists, leading researchers of ancient music and in particular of auloi—Stefan Hagel of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Peter Holmes of Middlesex University London, and Olga Sutkowska of the Universität der Künste Berlin—joined the project.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The expertise of the music archaeologists and their previous detailed studies of auloi in European collections have been indispensable.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The goal for their work was twofold: to assemble as many complete or near-complete instruments as possible, and to prepare detailed documentation that will hopefully lead to the production of playable replicas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sorting tube sections by internal and external diameters and other distinctive features, tentative arrangements of the first double pipes were made. For a couple of sections, the two abovementioned photographs taken of the fragments in situ were helpful, and corrosion patterns on the outer bronze tubes were taken into account throughout. Most of the material, however, found its likely place only with the help of a grid of relative finger-hole distances for the various notes of the ancient musical system, in combination with information on how these may have worked together, both from the remnants of ancient scores and from theoretical treatises. In addition, it needed to be assessed whether any proposed arrangement of finger holes could possibly be played by the human hand—taking into account the highly trained hands of ancient professional players with considerable finger spans evidenced from other aulos finds. As a first result, by June 2015, hypothetical layouts of eight pipes forming four instruments had been created, with at least four more pipes and additional tubing sections remaining to be studied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stefan Hagel returned in the fall of 2015 for a second study session and now six instruments are tentatively identified, consisting of twelve pipes and accounting for nearly all of the section fragments. Each double pipe is distinguished by different features, including length and mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconstruction of the two longest pairs—longer than any other ever found—was greatly helped by the fact that these instruments were musically very similar, differing only in the musical capabilities of their bass regions, far below the playing position of the hands. Their four tubes were also equipped with identical slider mechanisms that end in small dolphin sculptures, each one holding a seashell in its snout (see fig. 45.4). These shells would have covered sound holes and could be pushed up and down along the tubes to switch between two different bass notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the reconstruction of these four pipes had reduced the pool of fragments by twelve feet worth of tubing, the remaining eight pipes belonging to shorter instruments became easier to tackle. Four of these belonged to a previously unknown type of aulos without a bulb, terminating at their upper ends in a reed insert whose flare is nearly reciprocated at the lower ends. These came mostly with a wooden core and with hardly any rotating sleeves, forming the simplest instruments in the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the remaining two pairs had rotating sleeves throughout, resulting in relatively high-pitched and highly chromatic modulating instruments. Their reconstruction was encumbered by the sheer number of very small sections, where the short distances between the finger holes sometimes required compromises on the part of the makers, sacrificing exact intonation for the sake of fingering. However, in the end it proved possible to arrive at a musically meaningful interpretation of this group as well, which currently awaits corroboration first by physical modeling and then by experimental reconstruction. The former is done with specialized software that allows the assessment of pitches and scales of such instruments based on their physical parameters, establishing the optimal measurements of the lost reed mouthpieces as well as the likely placement of lost holes, in the very few cases where this may be required.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous smaller stray bronze elements, mostly broken away from the external layers of existing sections, still must be considered. These have now been sorted, rather like a jigsaw puzzle, into groups with specific edges, such as end sections of tubes, pieces with remnants of sound holes, small ring sections, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;concluding-remarks&#34;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future study sessions with the team members within the next year are anticipated. With the completion of reasonably accurate copies, the musical potential of such instruments could be rediscovered, adding immeasurably to our knowledge of music in the Roman period. A first trial by Stefan Hagel playing 3D-printed replicas of the “Wooden Pipes” took place in January 2016 in Paris during a conference focused on the making of ancient musical instruments, in part organized by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ifao.egnet.net/&#34;&gt;Institut français d’archéologie orientale&lt;/a&gt; (IFAO).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the PROMET European FP6 project, a micro-XRF mobile spectrometer was transported to the National Museum of Damascus, Syria, where it was applied to and validated for the quantitative noninvasive analysis of unique museum metal collections across the Mediterranean region, successfully addressing archaeological and conservation questions. Given the value of these collections, transport of objects or sampling for analysis is generally not permitted. Thus, the development and validation of a reliable portable technology is critical for comparisons of analytical compositional results, especially for similar museum collections or objects housed around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobile micro-XRF spectrometer of NCSR “Demokritos” was utilized in campaigns at the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Messene (Peloponnese), the Palace Armoury Museum in Malta, the Umm Qais and Numismatic Museums in Jordan, and the National Museum of Damascus, Syria. These studies revealed important information about their metals collections concerning the manufacturing techniques and the condition of objects from various periods, but more importantly developed a standard approach for validating the precision and accuracy of compositional data for ancient and historic copper and iron alloys, as well as gilding techniques from various periods. At the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Messene, high-tin bronze mirrors dating from the second century BC were analyzed to identify the composition of the alloy and corrosion products, as well as to characterize the reflecting gray-silverish and black-colored surface finishes of the mirrors.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Palace Armoury campaign included the XRF analysis of steel armor elements with emphasis on manufacturing techniques such as surface gilding.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At Yarmouk University in Jordan, Roman copper-alloy artifacts from the Umm Qais Museum were analyzed to characterize the metal composition and corrosion products,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while gold coins from the collection of the Numismatic Museum were also analyzed in order to identify compositional differences and elucidate the use of raw materials and processing practices through different historical periods. At the National Museum of Damascus, gilded copper and gold artifacts of the third millennium BC and from about 1500 BC were studied. The micro-XRF analysis was used for the first time to investigate the composition of copper and gold alloys and their corrosion products, the thickness of the gold foil used for the gilding, and finally to assess their state of preservation.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of these studies introduced and validated universal semi-quantitative criteria for the analysis of bronze artifacts using a certifiable quantification model, which was also tested during a comparison exercise organized by the Getty Museum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This approach is discussed here, based on the scientific examination of two unique Bronze Age figurines from the National Museum of Damascus. These gilded copper-alloy figurines represent the El god (the principal god of Ugarit) and the god Baal, both dated to the Late Bronze Age (fourteenth century BC) (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 46.1&lt;/strong&gt;). Compositional results of the copper alloys are presented to highlight the main problems in micro-XRF analysis of ancient bronzes, such as the heterogeneity of the alloys; the importance of using filters in the excitation path; and the production of reliable quantitative results. The scientific examination of the figurines allowed us to develop practical guidelines for micro-XRF users on how to generate good quality XRF analytical data that are representative of the bulk composition of the metal alloy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XRF spectrometry is the most popular technique for the elemental analysis of culture heritage (CH) objects,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; since it is noninvasive and can detect a wide range of elements, providing fast qualitative and in some cases validated quantitative results.
Despite the obvious advantages, the technique does have limitations, in particular when it is used for the analysis of CH metal objects utilizing an exciting X-ray beam with a size at the order of 0.1mm or below. The high spatial resolution of the exciting X-ray may produce misleading results for specific metal alloys. This is due to their micro-scale heterogeneity, which originates from the degree of solubility of the individual constituent elements and/or from the formation of corrosion products on the surface.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of quaternary copper (Cu) alloys with significant lead (Pb) concentration, segregation effects appear due to the immiscibility of the Cu and Pb phases, resulting in the concentration of Pb globules at the Cu grain boundaries.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Also, surface finishing techniques may result in partial removal of Pb from the inter-granular regions or to cause Pb smearing across the surface.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the case of bronzes, the corrosion process may alter the surface in particular due to the phenomenon of decuprification. For binary bronze alloys, the alteration of the surface is very well described by Luc Robbiola and colleagues, who proposed a factor to transform the analytical results obtained from the surface (corrosion layer) to those that represent the bulk of the metal alloy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another way to achieve reliable quantitative results is to distinguish corroded from “corrosion-free” surfaces, if such exist. In the case of binary (Cu-Sn) bronzes, the ratio of Sn Kα to Lα lines of the examined alloy was suggested&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in order to access a finishing technique or/and the alteration of the original alloy. Later on, this ratio was further developed as a robust semi-quantitative criterion to assess the presence or absence of surface alteration, which can be used for different XRF spectrometers and operational conditions.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another way to approach the original composition of the alloy is by using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) measurements combined with Monte Carlo methods.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem with the micro-XRF analysis of metals is the presence in the spectrum of peaks that energetically coincide with constituent elements’ characteristic X-rays. The surface of a “corrosion-free” metal alloy exhibits a rather polycrystalline structure. Therefore, when the X-ray tube continuum-Bremsstrahlung radiation is utilized as an excitation source, it is probable that the Bragg equation will be fulfilled at certain energies under a particular geometrical set-up configuration. More specifically, according to Bragg’s law:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; sin &lt;em&gt;θ&lt;/em&gt; = *n*λ, where&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = sample crystal lattice spacing;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;em&gt;θ&lt;/em&gt; = angle between the incident and the reflected beam from the
sample;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;λ = wavelength of the incident radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it might be possible that, for certain values of &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;θ&lt;/em&gt;, the aforementioned equation may be fulfilled by an incident wavelength λ contained within the polychromatic tube spectrum. As a consequence, various undesirable peaks that correspond to different orders of diffraction will appear in the spectrum and possibly interfere with characteristic X-rays of interest. The phenomenon is significantly enhanced with the highly focused exciting beam produced by X-ray lenses in micro-XRF spectrometers. In this case, due to the well-defined excitation geometry, the Bragg condition will be fulfilled by the majority of the incident flux at a particular energy, whereas with broader beams the diffraction peaks are less pronounced. The appearance of the diffraction peaks can be identified in the XRF spectra based on the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually a Bragg peak does not coincide with the tabulated energy of any characteristic X-ray, or if it does, it is not accompanied by the rest of the transition lines following the decay of an inner shell (K-, L-) hole. For example, if the energy of the diffraction peak coincides with the Κα line of one element, then depending on the presence of this particular element within the analyzed sample, the respective Κβ line either has an abnormal relative intensity with respect to the Κα line intensity or it would be completely absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically the diffraction peaks exhibit a broader shape than the typical characteristic X-ray peaks, which are modulated by the detector energy resolution and natural linewidth and not by the sample irradiation geometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the sample orientation is changed slightly with respect to the exciting beam, a respective shift in their energy is observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A standard methodology to minimize or even eliminate the presence of Bragg peaks in the spectrum is to introduce a strong absorber between the source and the sample/spot to filter the interfering part of the exciting radiation. Usually the low energy continuum (10 k eV) has a more pronounced probability of undertaking Bragg diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In micro-XRF analysis, a polycapillary X-ray lens is usually utilized in the excitation channel to collect efficiently, propagate, and focus to a few tens of micrometers the exciting X-ray beam radiation. Nevertheless, the X-ray lens introduces major difficulties in quantification, since its transmission efficiency—being highly dependent on the transmitted X-ray energy—results in significant and not easily predicted modifications of the energy distribution of the primary tube spectrum. Although quantitative analysis by direct comparison with a certified reference material (CRM) is a rather simple and straightforward approach, it assumes the availability of CRMs with a compositional profile (matrix) similar to the unknown one. This necessity can be avoided, however, by applying for the micro-XRF quantification analysis a fundamental parameters approach that utilizes an analytical description of the lens transmission efficiency.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This methodology is applied below for the compositional analysis of two gilded-bronze figurines from the National Museum of Damascus in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gilded-bronze-figurines-from-the-late-bronze-age&#34;&gt;The Gilded Bronze Figurines from the Late Bronze Age&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on the analysis of two gilded-bronze figurines using micro-XRF during the &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; campaign. The figurines belong to the Late Bronze Age (1400–1300 BC) and were discovered at the southern area of Ugarit, which was first excavated in 1929 by French archaeologists. Site research suggests that the city acted as a link between the Near East and the ancient Mediterranean world.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ugarit became the center of interaction between Egypt, Crete, Cyprus, and Anatolia, promoting an exchange of the earliest artistic styles within the ancient world. These statues represent ancient gods: the first one represents the El god (inv. RS23) and the other, the Baal god (inv. 3572) (see fig. 46.1). The El god figurine is in a seated position with its right hand raised, apparently in blessing, and its crown resembles the crown of Osiris. The stance of the Baal god is borrowed from Egyptian images of triumphant kings striding over their fallen enemies.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At that time, Ugarit art was highly influenced by Egyptian art, as can be observed in the examined artifacts. In another paper,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; we discussed the methodology for the micro-XRF analysis of the gilded parts of the objects. The examination of gilded areas showed the use of the foil gilding technique, determined the composition of the gilded areas, and revealed the use of different gold sheets on these objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;measurement-set-up&#34;&gt;Measurement Set-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific examination of the bronze figurines was carried out by a portable micro-XRF spectrometer (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 46.2&lt;/strong&gt;). This instrument was developed based on a commercial spectrometer (Bruker-Nano ARTAX) with optimized features regarding the design of the spectrometry head and the lens transmission efficiency at high energies (20 k eV). The spectrometer probe consists of an X-ray micro-focus Rh-anode tube (spot size 50 μm x 50 μm, max 50 kV, max 1 mA, 30W maximum power consumption, Be window 0.2 mm thickness); and a polycapillary X-ray lens as a focusing optical element (IFG), with focal distance equal to 21.2 mm and with spatial resolution of ~40–100 μm. The X-ray detection chain consists of an electro-thermally cooled 10 mm^2^ silicon drift detector (X-Flash, 1000B) with FWHM equal to 146 eV at 10 kcps coupled with a digital signal processor. A color CCD camera (ca. 13x magnification) is used for sample illumination and a dimmable white LED to produce a laser spot. Three different stepping motors, coupled with the spectrometer head, allow its movement in three-dimensions, to facilitate 2D scanning measurements. Finally, a portable supporting stand for the micro-XRF spectrometer (developed in-house) allows its vertical movement in a range of about 50 cm. The portable stand can be easily disassembled, packed, and transported to a museum or a site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;results-discussion&#34;&gt;Results/Discussion**&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Problem of Heterogeneity:&lt;/em&gt; The micro-scale heterogeneity of CH metals was validated during the PROMET campaign and was reported in the book &lt;em&gt;The Preservation of Metal Museum Collections from the Mediterranean Region: The PROMET Approach&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In this study, the examination of ancient copper alloys highlights the necessity of area mapping to deduce mean values of elemental intensities compared to single spot micro-XRF analysis. It is very characteristic that the homogeneity of the SRM BCR-691 copper alloys is ensured only for a beam spot size at the order of 5 mm due to their micro-scale heterogeneity. Typical copper alloys were analyzed by performing micro-XRF mapping in small (~0.5 x 0.5 mm^2^) and large (~5 x 5 mm^2^) areas. &lt;strong&gt;Table 46.1&lt;/strong&gt; reports the systematic area scans performed for the copper BCR-691Α alloy. The elemental intensities deduced from each area scan were averaged and the respective standard deviations (STDMV %) are presented. In addition, the table gives the standard deviation (%) of the mean value determined by averaging the individual mean values of all the area scans for a specific elemental intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these results, what would be an appropriate measurement methodology that would generate representative results of the metal alloy bulk composition? The following practical guidelines should be taken into account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scanning micro-XRF analysis should be conducted in at least three different areas ~1 mm x 1mm or larger, containing an adequate number of spot measurements (30) with step size equal to or slightly larger than the spatial resolution of the exciting beam (~0.1 mm in our case), and the respective mean average elemental intensities should be averaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a scanning mode of analysis cannot be applied, as many single spot measurements as possible should be taken at different areas of the analyzed surface to deduce mean elemental intensities that represent more accurately the bulk composition of the alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Need for Filtered Excitation:&lt;/em&gt; As discussed above, the surface of a bronze object exhibits a polycrystalline structure that may produce parasitic XRD peaks on the XRF spectrum that sometimes coincide with the energy region in which characteristic X-ray lines appear. The use of a filter in the excitation path can eliminate the influence of this phenomenon. Another advantage to using a filter is the improvement of peak-to-background at the energy region where minor or even trace elements (such as zinc, arsenic, or selenium) may be expected, and also the reduction of pile-up peaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, a single spot measurement was taken on the surface of the El-god figurine using unfiltered versus filtered excitation. In the case of bronze alloy analysis, the selected filter consisted of a sandwich of the following materials: cobalt (Co) (17.7 ± 1.3) μm, titanium (Ti) (23.64 ± 0.18) μm, and palladium (Pd) (11.3 ± 0.3) μm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both spectra (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 46.3&lt;/strong&gt;) showed that the statue is made of a binary copper-tin alloy with some traces of iron, zinc, and arsenic. In the case of the filtered excitation, the background was reduced, and the presence of selenium and lead traces in the alloy was revealed. The detection of trace elements is extremely important in archaeometric studies, because it can give clues about the provenance of raw materials and the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface Corrosion Products:&lt;/em&gt; The identification of a patina layer or surface corrosion products in XRF analysis relies on the detection of particular elements, mostly of elements with low atomic number like sulfur (S) or chlorine (Cl), which are signs/fingerprints of certain types of copper- or tin-related corrosion products. Another criterion is applicable when medium atomic number elements like tin are included in the bulk composition of the metal alloy. For example, in bronze alloys the variation of the (L/K) intensity ratio for the Sn-characteristic X-rays among different corroded and corrosion-free areas can indicate the presence of an alteration of the original alloy surface. The intensity of L X-ray lines, due to their significantly lower energy relative to the K-lines, is mostly affected by the at-depth distribution of the element, that is, whether it is on the surface layer or below; thus, a higher value probes a surface location of tin, whereas a lower- or negligible-value L-intensity gives direct evidence that a surface layer without tin acts as an absorbing layer. Moreover, in order to probe efficiently the elements S, Cl, and Sn L-X-rays, an unfiltered tube radiation is suitable as an exciting X-ray source. It should be stressed that the XRF analysis cannot identify the mineralogical type of a corrosion product, as the XRD or FTIR analysis can. However, through the elemental analysis, XRF can reveal elemental associations compatible with particular types of corrosion products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An area map was performed at the back of the El god figurine (see fig. 46.1a). The black quadrangle in &lt;strong&gt;figure 46.4a&lt;/strong&gt; defines the area of analysis, which shows both black and green coloration. The measurement conditions were set at 50 kV, 600μA, 30s/step, 0.1mm/step, total area of analysis 0.5 × 0.8 mm^2^ (42 measurements). In &lt;strong&gt;figures 46.4b and c&lt;/strong&gt;, the Cu Kα and the ratio of Sn Lα/Kα elemental intensities in each analyzed area are presented. The warm colors correspond to higher intensity values: therefore in the green region (on the right side of the scan) the increment of Cu Kα line points to the formation of a green copper-corrosion product (possibly malachite due to absence of S and Cl from the recorded spectra); whereas in the black area (down and left) the increment of Sn characteristic lines reveals the formation of a black tin corrosion products (possibly tin oxides).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Certifiable Quantitative Results:&lt;/em&gt; The XRF screening of reddish-brown areas on the surface of the Baal god figurine (see for example photos of three selected areas, &lt;strong&gt;fig. 46.5a–c&lt;/strong&gt;) could indicate (in principle) corrosion-free areas as opposed to those with the presence of reddish corrosion products (most likely cuprite). It is not possible to discriminate such areas by visual examination alone. This new methodology for screening was previously proposed,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; wherein the relative ratio of Sn Kα/Lα to the respective value obtained by a reference binary Cu-Sn alloy was used as a criterion for identifying an area altered by corrosion. This ratio was theoretically calculated and experimentally found to be rather constant, being independent of the tin content, the measurement/excitation conditions (filtered/unfiltered excitation, operational voltage, irradiation geometry, micro- or milli-beam), and the type of the XRF spectrometer (anode material, detection system, etc.). Since the established criterion was fulfilled for only one spot (fig. 46.5b), quantitative results obtained for other analyzed spots were abandoned. In order to have an idea of the errors that could be introduced in the quantitative results for the bronze alloy, figure 46.5 reports also the elemental concentrations as deduced from the analytical micro-XRF data obtained for spots (a) and &amp;copy;. It is clear that without incorporating the universal screening criterion developed for the bronze alloys, the compositional results could indicate much higher Sn concentration (260% and 156%, respectively) than the actual value, suggesting a different manufacturing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the PROMET project, a portable micro-XRF spectrometer, based on an industrial prototype but with custom-selected hardware components and measurement head, was utilized on two bronze figurines housed at the National Museum of Damascus. Optimized analysis protocols were developed with the aim of achieving an accurate and precise compositional analysis of the Cu alloys, overcoming spectral interferences that arise due to the polycrystalline nature of the alloy’s surface. Filters for the detection of bronze alloys should first be tested and the minimum representative area of analysis should be examined and specified on reference bronze alloys. Finally, the quantification procedure should only be used on corrosion-free areas in order to produce reliable analytical results. This paper outlined this methodological approach to carry out verifiable and reproducible compositional analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On display in the Harvard Art Museums is a statuette of Alexander the Great, sometimes referred to as the Alexander Nelidow after its first known owner.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The statuette first appeared in the Istanbul bazaar sometime before 1897.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The original condition of the surface when excavated can only be guessed at: the surface had already been cleaned of any unsightly burial accretions by the time the first images appear.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Alexander is depicted as a nude youth, standing with his left arm raised, probably to grasp a spear. His head is turned sharply toward the left, while his right arm is bent with hand placed on his right hip (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 47.1&lt;/strong&gt;). His torso is heavily muscled on the front and back. The legs below the knee are restorations. The statuette was sold at auction in 1911.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By 1954, it was in the possession of C. Ruxton Love, Jr.,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who donated it to Harvard’s Fogg Art Museum in 1956.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alexander statuette’s authenticity as an ancient work has been called into question on occasion, most recently in 2014 when the results of lead isotope analysis indicated that the statuette had an isotopic composition distinct from that of ore sources believed to have been used in Graeco-Roman times and from that of published copper alloy and lead objects of the period.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These analytical results provided the impetus to reevaluate the Alexander and to wonder if there is a final authority in authenticity studies. Is there ever going to be a point where one can look at objects and say, definitively, this one is fake and this one is an authentic antiquity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some light can be shed on this question using the work that curators, conservators, and material scientists have been doing for almost fifty years on bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums, particularly on the almost 1,300 copper alloy objects in the museums’ Ancient Art department in preparation for the online special collection, &lt;em&gt;Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; All objects were examined by members of the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies for information on manufacture and condition, almost 1,000 were written up by art historians, and about 900 were tested for alloy composition using a variety of destructive and nondestructive methods. These techniques included ICP-MS/AAA, XRF, EMPA, SEM-EDX, ICP-OES.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For this paper, we shall also draw on the data of a group of modern copper-alloy objects and pieces of uncertain antiquity for comparison with data from the Alexander, in order to explore issues that might help determine the statuette’s authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous doubts about the Alexander Nelidow have come from the art historical perspective. The statuette has been published about thirty times between 1897 and the present.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In his 1898 monograph on the statuette, Oskar Wulff suggested that it is a copy of a statue known to us as “Alexander with a Lance” by Lysippos (a work that was possibly described by Plutarch&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). The identification is based on the arrangement of his hair, the stance­—holding a spear now lost—and the left turn of his head, which would fit the possible descriptions of the statue.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Although most publications of Harvard’s statuette accept that it does represent Alexander the Great (or a Hellenistic ruler), that it may be a copy after a Lysippan original, and that it was made in the Hellenistic or Roman periods, questions remain as to whether it is a copy based on “Alexander with a Lance,” and indeed if such a statue even existed. A few of these publications reascribed the Alexander Nelidow from an ancient date to a more recent, even modern, one. The most important of these was by Diana Buitron, who suggested that the Alexander is a Renaissance piece based on stylistic similarities, particularly in the musculature, that she saw with certain fifteenth to sixteenth century AD bronze statuettes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Stylistic criteria can be highly subjective, however, and Buitron’s arguments are not concrete enough to securely date the Harvard statuette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;copies&#34;&gt;Copies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at comparative pieces for more objective criteria by which to identify fakes, one fact that has emerged is that some of the statuettes in Harvard’s ancient art collection are modern or likely modern copies (exact or only slightly adapted) of other statuettes. Of course, close copies of large-scale bronze sculptures are known,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the statuettes in question are not copies of standard statue types. It is worth stressing that the antiquity of these statuettes was not called into question based solely on their status as duplicates, but based on a combination of criteria including lack of corrosion or alloy composition that is inconsistent with securely dated ancient pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are statuette types that are known “souvenir” replicas, like Harvard’s copy of the Dancing Faun from Pompeii, which was probably made as a souvenir of the Grand Tour.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Its corrosion pattern does not suggest long-term burial, and its alloy composition is inconsistent with that of ancient pieces. Another example of this type may be a plaque of a sacrificial ram with attendant, which entered Harvard’s collection as an antiquity.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This piece lacks corrosion and contains over 5% zinc, both of which are red flags for fakes;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it was nevertheless accepted as likely ancient until a very similar version from Pompeii was identified in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples. The similarity of the pieces suggests that the Harvard version was copied from the Naples bronze. As a result, the Harvard example was reclassified as modern.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another questionable object, of a Sardinian shepherd and ram group,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is probably a forgery meant to appear ancient. Its constituent alloy is completely unlike other Sardinian pieces, containing around 15% zinc: of about 130 such objects with published alloys, only one other has more than 1% zinc.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The corrosion is thick, up to 1.5 mm in some areas, but jumbled and uneven, sometimes lacking the usual layer of red cuprite under the green corrosion. It was found to have great similarities to a wrestler group in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Cagliari: the Harvard statuette mimics one of the wrestlers and replaces the other figure with a ram.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A draped female figure in the Harvard collection, which also lacks indications of corrosion from long-term burial and has an alloy containing over 30% zinc, is identical to at least 4 and up to 11 other statuettes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:22&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is also uncertain which statuette in this case would be the original upon which the others are based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the authenticity of a statuette is not immediately confirmed or undermined by being a close copy (or not) of another piece, this is often a cause for concern, particularly when combined, as in the above cases, with other reasons to doubt the objects’ antiquity. In contrast, although it has close cousins, both large and small scale,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:23&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the Alexander Nelidow is not an exact copy of any other known statuette, so we must turn to other evidence to support, or refute, its antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;manufacture&#34;&gt;Manufacture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of examining objects for the ancient bronzes special collection, the conservation team identified some oddities related to methods of manufacture that have implications for the authenticity of some objects. One piece that has been difficult to authenticate portrays a comic actor in the role of a kitchen slave (inv. 2001.257).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:24&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The raised ridges along the exterior of the legs appear to be traces of piece-mold lines, a feature one would not expect to find on a Graeco-Roman bronze and which may be an indication that it was cast from a mold taken from an existing copper-alloy statuette. Filed-down mold lines were also observed on the statuette of the draped female figure mentioned above (inv. 1932.56.27).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conservation team was recently able to compare Harvard’s statuette of the orator Demosthenes (inv. 2007.221), based on a famous statue of the third century BC by Polyeuktos,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:25&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with an aftercast of the statuette made in Germany in the early twentieth century.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:26&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Comparison of X-radiographs of the ancient Demosthenes statuette and the aftercast reveals very different interiors, with a clear armature on the inside of the aftercast (&lt;strong&gt;figs. 47.2–3&lt;/strong&gt;). Study of the object at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Research revealed that the thick corrosion on the surface of the original is replicated on the aftercast as a rough, bumpy surface with no indication of corrosion products; a similar surface also appears on the draped female statuette described above (inv. 1932.56.27).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of manufacture, there is nothing unusual about Alexander: the statuette is solid cast, probably by a lost-wax technique, although due to the surface condition it cannot be determined with certainty whether it was a direct or indirect cast. Again, the Alexander shows none of the concerns that were noted for other suspect pieces and were used to help condemn these as modern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;corrosion&#34;&gt;Corrosion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of corrosion cannot be used by itself to authenticate or date an object, but its total absence is a very good indication, in combination with other data, that a piece may not be ancient. The mineralized surface of the Alexander statuette was pared down to the interface of preserved metal before its earliest photograph was published in 1898.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:27&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In spite of this extensive “restoration” treatment, Alexander retains thick patches of red and green corrosion products usually associated with cuprite and malachite, although we have tended not to use analysis to confirm the identification of corrosion products (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 47.4&lt;/strong&gt;). Thick corrosion layers and intergranular corrosion can both be good indicators of long-term burial—and thus great age—but it is impossible to extrapolate from these the exact length of time an object was buried. That said, one must bear in mind that corrosion or patination can be created or enhanced artificially.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:28&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The cuprite on another Harvard bronze—a modern copy of half of a fifth-century BC Etruscan candelabrum group portraying a standing warrior—also has some red and green corrosion; in this case, the red corrosion was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy to be cuprite (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 47.5&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:29&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As with the Sardinian shepherd-and ram-group, the thickness of the corrosion varies. The corrosion on the standing-warrior bronze could be mistaken for evidence of long-term burial if we did not know that the piece was a copy of an original candelabrum group excavated at Marzabotto, Italy, held in private hands, which the owners had reproduced for the Marzabotto Museum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:30&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:30&#34;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Harvard’s warrior could easily have been made at the same time as the other known copies. Harvard also owns a copy of another candelabrum finial from Marzabotto of a youth carrying an amphora, which was also replicated and sold.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:31&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:31&#34;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Results of compositional and isotopic analysis indicate that the metal composition of the two replicas of Marzabotto bronzes at Harvard is very similar, perhaps from the same batch of metal, though not the same pour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;metal-alloy&#34;&gt;Metal Alloy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usefulness of alloy analysis to date bronzes has been debated, due, among other things, to the recycling of metal throughout history.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:32&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:32&#34;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nevertheless, alloy analysis has revealed broader patterns and helped to identify anachronisms. Certain alloys seem not to have been used during specific periods: brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, for instance, has long been thought to be uncommon in antiquity before the Roman times. Yet, even there, as we use different tools to gather more data on the composition of copper alloy objects, the overall picture becomes more complex. Brass, we now know, does occur before the Roman period—but is still rare and occurs only in certain contexts or in certain types of objects.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:33&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:33&#34;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, Harvard’s Alexander was sampled and tested by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), which suggested that it contained 1% zinc. More recent tests give quite different results, with only a trace or no zinc detected.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:34&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:34&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The variation between the datasets probably reflects improvements in analytical methods since the 1970s and the benefits of sampling for clean metal versus surface analysis, as the readings of surface composition are often distorted by the presence of corrosion. As a leaded bronze with trace zinc, Alexander’s alloy composition is entirely normal for a Roman statuette. Based on data gathered at Harvard and further afield, it can be noted that the presence of (1) zinc above a few percent, (2) cadmium above the detection limit, and (3) high zinc without tin are all suspicious for ancient copper-alloy statuettes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:35&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:35&#34;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Of the 600 Harvard objects tested, around 80 objects had 5% zinc or higher (with a maximum of 48% zinc): 80% of these high-zinc pieces are known or suspected to be fakes or are known to date from the Byzantine to Islamic periods, and almost all of the statuettes with zinc above 5% are believed to be fake based on analyses of their corrosion products and art historical comparanda.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:36&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:36&#34;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lead-isotope-analysis&#34;&gt;Lead Isotope Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead isotope analysis relies on the fact that ore sources containing lead have a characteristic isotopic “fingerprint,” which can help to pinpoint the source of a lead-containing copper alloy or lead deposit. However, interpretation of the isotopic composition of an object is complicated because more than one lead-containing source may be present, either due to mixing of metal ores in the original alloy or (more commonly) as a result of mixing from the recycling of metal objects. Lead isotope analysis of Harvard’s Alexander and Demosthenes statuettes was performed in 2014. Both of these statuettes contain over 5% lead, so the measured isotopic composition of both reflects the ores of the lead that was deliberately added as an alloying ingredient, rather than being inherited from trace lead within the copper ores. A comparison of the lead isotopes of the two statuettes to known Graeco-Roman lead ore sources shows that the Demosthenes and the ores plot along the same line, while Alexander’s lead is notably separate (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 47.6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:37&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:37&#34;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In order to better understand the lead isotopes of modern or fake copper-alloy objects, we sampled several known and suspected later copper-alloy objects at Harvard, as well as a few authentic pieces for comparison (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 47.7&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:38&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:38&#34;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; While the modern pieces and replicas cluster to higher values, they still plot along the line of possible Graeco-Roman lead ores. Even when we enlarged the plot to include more exotic ores from outside Europe and the Mediterranean, such as those from India&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:39&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:39&#34;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Australia,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40&#34;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and modern gasoline lead&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:from-lead-added-to-gasoline-which-gives-a-good-average-for-available-modern-lead&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:from-lead-added-to-gasoline-which-gives-a-good-average-for-available-modern-lead&#34;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 47.8&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:42&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:42&#34;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the isotopic composition of lead from the Alexander Nelidow remained separate. This separation cannot be explained by the melting down and reuse of metals with different lead sources: recycling would simply give values that plot along the same line. The only way to produce such an anomalous value is to find an exotic source plotting above the line. One such possibility is provided by lead ores from Morocco, which do fall in a distinct field above the main isotopic line close to the value of the Alexander statuette (&lt;strong&gt;fig. 47.9&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:43&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:43&#34;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Although, more research is needed to determine whether Moroccan ores were actually exploited in the Roman period, studies of lead curse tablets from Roman Carthage show that Tunisian lead was used in these objects, proving exploitation of at least some lead sources local to North Africa in the appropriate period.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:44&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:44&#34;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this unusual lead isotope analysis result is not enough to condemn the statuette, as it had seemed at first, but neither should one use this result to make statements about its date, origin, or authenticity. There is still a surprising lack of available lead isotope analysis of Roman copper-alloy objects. In order to better interpret the isotopic composition of suspect pieces, a reliable database of well-provenanced Roman bronzes (ideally statuettes and similar objects) on the one hand, and of modern and late bronzes of similar typology on the other, is required to characterize more clearly how the data may vary. This would seem to be an ideal research project for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has given a very brief overview of a large trove of data in order to explore issues of authenticity in relation to copper-alloy objects generally, and to revisit earlier doubts concerning the antiquity of the Alexander Nelidow in particular. Research into the style, method of manufacture, surface corrosion, alloy, and lead isotopes produces no definitive evidence that this statuette is other than ancient. While a copper-alloy artifact can never be completely vindicated once questions have been raised about its authenticity, the systematic collaboration between curators, conservators, and material scientists can significantly elucidate and clarify our understanding of the piece. But it is important that these professionals work closely together, understanding each other’s methodologies, aims, and conclusions.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:45&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:45&#34;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; More careful examination of objects under microscopes, more sampling, and more research and analysis by such interdisciplinary teams can vastly improve knowledge of our collections.&lt;/p&gt;

It is likely that both &amp;gt; aftercasts were created at the same time, in the early twentieth &amp;gt; century when Harvard’s statuette is known to have been in Germany. &amp;gt; The aftercast from the private collection is a mixed copper alloy; &amp;gt; it was tested with XRF (alloying elements: copper, lead, zinc, &amp;gt; tin; other elements: nickel, iron, antimony) and ICP-OES (Cu, &amp;gt; 80.09%; Sn, 5.17%; Pb, 2.55%; Zn, 7.81%; Fe, 0.20%; Ni, 0.28%; Ag, &amp;gt; 0.01%; Sb, 0.24%; As, 0.10%; Co, 0.001%; Au, not detected; Cd, &amp;gt; 0.003%). The second aftercast in Munich was also tested by XRF and &amp;gt; has a similar composition to the aftercast from the private &amp;gt; collection. Thanks are due to Susanne Ebbinghaus and Josef &amp;gt; Riederer for providing information about the aftercast in Munich &amp;gt; and to Josef Riederer for providing the analysis of the Munich &amp;gt; piece.
