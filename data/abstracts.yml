        In 1993, 2012, and 2014, well-preserved partial remains of a large bronze-workshop were uncovered at the Sanctuary of Zeus in Jerash. Thanks to the close cooperation among Jordanian, German, and French specialists, more than 3,000 mold fragments have been restored and the other relevant installations of the workshop, dated of the second half of the second century AD, preserved. All the pieces will be accessible, as a world unique cultural heritage monument of Jordan, through an exhibit in the Jordan National Museum.

        The bronze-workshop was located on the lower terrace of the Zeus sanctuary. At the moment, its remains include four large molds pits, with traces of large-sized copper-alloy cast objects at the bottom of them (two circular, two rectangular in plan). Some 3,000 pieces of the smashed mold mantle (consisting of baked earth), along with numerous fragments of the furnaces and other installations, had been dumped into these pits when the casting process was finished. The negative impression on the interiors of the mold fragments led to the conclusion that large-sized draped statuary, as well as other objects (cultic instruments?), were fabricated in this workshop by the lost-wax procedure.

        The main goal of this paper is to present the discovery and underwater survey of the ancient Apoxyomenos and to explore the mystery of how the statue ended up at the bottom of the sea.

        A Belgian diver, R. Wouters, discovered the bronze statue of the Apoxyomenos by chance while diving in the waters off the island of Mali Lošinj in the Republic of Croatia. The statue was found at a depth of 46 meters, on a curved seabed, stuck between two rocks. After very exacting preparations, which included the advice of many experts, the process of excavation began. The statue was brought to the surface with the cooperation of underwater archaeologists and members of the special police. Afterward, the Apoxyomenos was delivered to conservators. A month of research was then conducted at the underwater site where the statue was found.

        The research was international in character, with English, Belgian, and Croatian divers. They were driven by the same goal: to find other discoveries and possibly the underwater shipwreck. Unfortunately, despite detailed investigation with underwater metal detectors and waterpipes, the shipwreck has never been found. Does this mean that we will never find out how the Apoxyomenos ended up on the seabed? To answer this question, we will have to look more deeply into historical, geographical, climatic, and nautical contexts.
