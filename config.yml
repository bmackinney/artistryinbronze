#
# This is the main configuration file for the website. The 'theme' value should
# match the name of the folder in /themes that contains your theme files; if
# you've copied the default theme and given it a different name make sure to
# update the value here too.

# BaseURL: this should include the Hostname and Path (if any) where the site
# will live when it is built. If your baseurl includes a path component
# (i.e. "/canto-catalogue/" in the example below) then you can preview the
# site at localhost:1313/canto-catalogue/ when running the server.
#
# If your baseURL only has a host-name ("http://my-awesome-site.com/") then
# you'll preview it at localhost:1313.

# Menu: the 'main' menu will be picked up in the sidebar navigation menu in the
# default theme. Other menus can be defined here as well for use with custom
# theme files. To control order, give items a weight; lower numbers will appear
# first. Negative values are allowed.
